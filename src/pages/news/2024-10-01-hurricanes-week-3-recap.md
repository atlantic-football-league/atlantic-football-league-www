In AFL competition in Saint John, N.B. on Saturday, the football Hurricanes kept the Saint John Falcons winless with a 43-10 win, improving their record to 2-1 and moving up to second in the standings over the UNB Reds.

Although the Falcons had the stronger start, going up 3-0 with over five minutes remaining in the first quarter, Holland got back into the game with a field goal to tie the game and a touchdown by rookie running back Pierce Saunders (St. Patrick’s, P.E.I.) to take a 10-3 lead. The ‘Canes took control of the rest of the game with further points added by second-year receiver Wolf Sym (Tillsonburg, Ontario) and fourth-year quarterback Hunter Prus (Bedeque, P.E.I.).

The two teams are set to have a rematch next Sunday, Oct. 6 at the UPEI Alumni Canada Games Place in Charlottetown. Game time is at 1 p.m.
