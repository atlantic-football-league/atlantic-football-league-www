**Friday, October 5, 2018. Charlottetown, PE –** The Holland College Hurricanes are coming off a tough double OT road loss to the Dalhousie Tigers, but the players know what they need to do better.

“We need to be more disciplined and take care of our penalties,” said defensive back Duncan Hill. Something wide receiver Thomas Cassidy said the team has been working on.
 
“We’re getting disciplined in practices now for penalties and it’s energizing the team.”

The Hurricanes are excited and ready for the Thanksgiving Showdown.

Coach Young sums up what the Hurricanes need to do to be successful on game day with one word: Execute.

“The team is working hard, and has great focus and energy. I’m confident that this week we can take care of business,” he said.

Defensive back Duncan Hill agreed.

“We’ve had some veteran guys go down with injuries, so it’s become that next man up mentality, so discipline is key,” said Hill.

When it comes to Sunday’s rematch against the Tigers, running back Kepler Saint Hilaire is all about getting revenge.

“We need to remember they beat us. The coaches need to know they can all the depth,” he said.
The ‘Canes will try to settle the score against the Tigers in Sunday’s Turkey Bowl at UPEI Canada Games Alumni Field at 1 p.m.
