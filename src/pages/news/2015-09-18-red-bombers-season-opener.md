Last year, the UNB Red Bombers football team limped into the playoffs with a 2-5 record and were ousted in the first round by the eventual winners, Holland College.

This year, the Bombers will look to get back into form and compete for the Atlantic Football League title. The Bombers are bolstered by a revamped team, led by first year head coach Dan McCullough.

Also joining the squad this season is former Mount Allison WR Josh Blanchard, who was an integral part of the back-to-back AUS titles the Mounties won in 2013 and 2014. Coach McCullough is one of many who are pleased to have Blanchard on the roster.

“He brings instant credibility and leadership to our team and he is a highly talented weapon we can use in many different ways,” said head coach McCullough.

Two defensive players to watch this year are Alex White and Charlie Dee, who have both had impressive off-seasons where they each worked on many aspects of their game. White has the potential to create a big play, in the form of a turnover, at any point in the game while Dee will be all over the field, using his athleticism and toughness to rack up tackles.

One of the reasons for the Bomber’s disappointing 2014 campaign was the offensive line’s inability to give their quarter-back time to throw the ball, and their struggle to create lanes for their running-backs.

Coach McCullough said that the offensive line is much improved this year and, as a unit, has had a very strong training camp. He believes that they will play an important role in winning games this upcoming season.One of coach McCullough’s goals for this year and beyond will be to reignite the passion within his club and fan base.

“The team is looking great,” said McCullough. “We have a very solid group of dedicated and talented individuals who are buying into what we are trying to accomplish with this team, which is to improve the overall culture of the program.”

The Red Bombers begin their season this Saturday versus their cross province rivals, the UNB Saint John Sea Wolves. The game will kick off at 8 p.m. The Bombers play hosts to the Dalhousie Tigers in their homecoming game Saturday, Sept. 26 at 1 p.m.
