The Dalhousie Football Tigers evened their Atlantic Football League record to 2-2 with a 15-6 victory over the UNB Saint John Seawolves in Saint John on Saturday evening.  In a game dominated by defences the Tigers led 8-1 at half time.

Zach Leger again led all rushers (18/110) and scored on a twelve yard touchdown run in the second quarter.  Gullimae Bernier who scored a single on a missed field goal in the first quarter converted.

In the third quarter, Dal QB Nick Hunsley (15/22 for 238) connected with Alex Bayne on a
26 yard aerial major culminating a 105 yard third quarter march.  Bernier, the game's leading receiver (6/103) capped the Tiger's scoring with the PAT making the score 15-0 at the end of three quarters.

The Seawolves mounted a late fourth quarter attack as Sean Galbraith hit Alex Peabody on a 15 yard scoring strike but the convert was missed.  Saint John's defence held the Tigers to a three and out.  But Dal penalties for unnecessary roughness and pass interference saw the Seawolves scrimmaging first and goal with 30 seconds remaining in the game. 

The Tigers' defence held for the 15-6 victory.  Dalhousie will be at Wickwire Field next Saturday at 7 for Homecoming and the second of two games which will culminate in the awarding of the inaugural Alumni Cup with UNB Fredericton.  The Red Bombers won the first contest 37-31 in overtime earlier this season.
