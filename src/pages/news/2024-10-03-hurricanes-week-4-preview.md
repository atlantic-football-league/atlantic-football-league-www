The 2-1 football Hurricanes seek one last salute to their fans in the regular season with their final home game against the winless, 0-3 Saint John Falcons at the UPEI Alumni Canada Games Place in Charlottetown on Sunday.

It’s set to be an interesting rematch after Holland defeated Saint John 43-10 on Saturday, Sept. 21 on the road. A win for the ‘Canes would put them in a tie with the undefeated, 3-0 Dalhousie Tigers for the AFL lead while a win for the Falcons would tie them with the 1-2 UNB Reds for third.

Game time is at 1 p.m. Watch the game live at[www.youtube.com/@gocanesgo](http://www.youtube.com/@gocanesgo)

Keep an eye out for the following players:

\- Rookie running back Pierce Saunders (St. Patricks, P.E.I.) - most recent Hurricanes Football Player of the Week, scored a touchdown in the team’s win against Saint John on Sept. 21.

\- Second-year receiver Wolf Sym (Tillsonburg, Ontario) has been playing strong as of late, scoring multiple times last Saturday on the road.

\- Fourth-year quarterback Hunter Prus (Bedeque, P.E.I.) has only gained confidence through the opening three weeks of play, leading the Hurricanes offence.
