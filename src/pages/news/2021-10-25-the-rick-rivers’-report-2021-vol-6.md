All season, Dal head coach Haggett has praised the quantity, quality, and the depth he has on this year’s Dalhousie Tiger team.And no more was this evident than on an overcast drizzly afternoon at Wickwire Field.A few hundred loyal fans turned out and were shocked as the UNBSJ Seawolves took an early 7-0 lead.Noah Forgrave recovered a Dal fumble and sprinted 60 yards for the games’ opening touchdown.Jason Beach converted and the black and gold were down, 7-0 at the 12:13 mark of the first quarter.



The Seawolves score was a surprise but not as much of a surprise to the Tiger loyals as the performance of those on the deep levels of the depth chart.For various reasons, the Tigers did not dress a number of their stars and starters.Backup QB, Colton Allen had a very good day completing longish TD strikes to Noah Glover (38) and Jack Ferguson (36) and taking a keeper for six points. The list does not stop here as eight different players crossed the goal line, making the final score, 73-7 Dalhousie.



Allen and later Ferguson showed their poise at the QB position as they moved the team in Duplisea’s absence, as did Liam Chisari (7/75-1TD) and Adam Johnston (6/78-2TDs), as they filled for the resting Dylan Waugh.The one constant of course is the sterling performance of the offensive line, mentored by Andre Goguan and Shawn McIntyre.



The defence was again above reproach.Jeremy Miller, Max Parker and Aiden Keefe all contributed INTs while Adam Leskowait had his pick wiped out by a penalty.Christian Riley had a big sack and James Young two points on a safety.James Qi had a fumble recovery for a TD.Wow!There were not a lot of tackles by the Cats because of Dal’s time of possession.The continuous running of the clock when the black and gold were up thirty-five points also cut down potential numbers.



Other Dalhousie scorers included:Luke Smith and Steve Sorrenson, on 10 and 6-yard touchdown runs, respectively. Reid Marchand kicked 5 PATs and two point converts by Matt Lindsay, Chisari and Ferguson came on passes from Allen.



The Dalhousie Tigers (5-1) finished the AFL regular season tied in first place with the UNB Fredericton Reds with 10 points. On the basis of points for and against between the two involved teams, the Dal squad will take first place and have a rematch with the Seawolves at 8 pm on Saturday in one semi-final. The Reds who finished second will play Holland College in the other semi-final in Fredericton.If the Tigers win their semi, the Atlantic Football League final will be played on Wickwire Field on the Dalhousie Campus at 1pm on November 6th.



Triumphant coach Haggett has just proven what he thought/knew would be true, the Tigers can go deep on their massive roster with positive results.And Dalhousie fans know Chris and Colton can take their receivers deep on the passing tree.



Hope to see Tiger Nation out in force at Wickwire Field the next two Saturdays cheering on your black and gold.The Dalhousians last won the title in 2018.

**GO TIGERS!!**
