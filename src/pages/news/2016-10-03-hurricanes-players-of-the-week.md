***Charlottetown –*** The Hurricanes Football Club announced four players of the week. The honours are based on their performance in the team’s last game, against the Saint John Seawolves, and their efforts in practices. Running back Stevie Julien rushed for over 150 yards and had a 15 yard touchdown run in the game. Defensive back Joey Loopie worked tirelessly in practice and made key plays in the Hurricanes special teams, earning him special team honours. The team’s defense was led by the play of linemen Jake Rushford and D’Vac Munroe, both of whom receive defensive players of the week recognition for their efforts.

The Hurricanes play this Saturday evening against the Dalhousie Tigers in Halifax. The next home game will be on Saturday, October 15 at noon at UPEI Alumni Canada Games Place. Please note, the game is an hour earlier than the previously posted start time of 1 p.m.
