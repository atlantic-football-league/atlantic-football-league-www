**Thursday, October 18, 2018. Charlottetown –** The Holland College Hurricanes football team knows they can beat any team in the league, just ask their coach.

“When we play for 60 minutes, we can beat anyone,” said head coach Ross Young.

Young is hoping the team will prove it come Sunday in the last game of the regular season, against the UNB Fredericton Red Bombers.

“We are expecting they will adjust to us, and we need to adjust to them,” said Young.  “The extra day is going to be helpful for our guys to prepare.”’

Fullback Joey Boniface like the sound of that. He said playing the game on Sunday gives the team more time to get their heads in the game.

“It’s another day to study our playbooks, rest and take mental reps,” he said.

The team is happy to be playing on home turf this week, as the home fans always spur them on.

“It makes playing easier when we have a great crowd in the seats,” said defensive end Gordon Harding.

Coach Young agreed.

“We have great organizers and fans who make it a great game day experience for players and for the crowd,” he said.

The Hurricanes will be looking to avenge last week’s loss to Fredericton while trying to clinch a home game semi-final.

“We have made adjustments, but the main thing is execute, on both sides of the ball,” said Young.

His players have the same mindset as well.

“We need to cover deep better and get going on the first play and we need to play hardnosed football,” said Harding.

The game against the UNB Fredericton Red Bombers on Sunday at UPEI Alumni Field at 1p.m.
