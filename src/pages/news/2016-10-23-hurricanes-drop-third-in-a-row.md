***Charlottetown, PE -*** The Dalhousie Tigers remained perfect on the season, defeating the Holland College Hurricanes 33-7 Saturday afternoon at UPEI Alumni Canada Games Place.

Former Hurricane Nick Hunsley put on a show, throwing touchdown passes to three different receivers while finishing the game 14-for-21 with 290 yards for the Tigers.

“Hunsley had one of the best games of his career,” said Tigers head coach Mark Haggett. “He’s one of our leaders offensively and he stepped up in a big way.”

The Hurricanes struggled to match the efficiency of the Tigers offence, scoring just one touchdown, set up by punter Liam Carter who faked a punt and ran it 75 yards down field. Van Bodden then finished the drive with a 5-yard dash into the end zone.

“Our offence was on the field more, but we still have work to do,” said Hurricanes head coach Ross Young. “Our offence was playing with more confidence, but our defense has to shut down the big play.”

The Tigers wasted little time getting on the scoreboard. On their third drive of the game, following a 49-yard Guillaume Bernier run, Hunsley found wideout Darcy Chant behind the goal line for a 12-yard score and an early 8-0 advantage.

After conceding a safety, the Hurricanes opened the second quarter with a promising drive that ended in a missed field goal. On the ensuing play, Tigers running back Zack Leger got in on the action, sprinting 95 yards for the touchdown to extend their lead 17-0. Leger’s presence up the middle was felt throughout the game as he surpassed the century mark with 134 yards rushing.

Before the end of the first half, Hunsley connected on back-to-back passes – one to Chant for 37 yards and the other to Bernier for a 40-yard touchdown reception – pushing the lead to 23-0.

Hunsley continued his strong play in the third quarter, finding Spencer Muise in the back of the end zone for a 21-yard major and a 30-0 lead.

Hurricanes halfback Bodden was the beneficiary of Carter’s fake punt, scoring on the 5-yard rush to trim the deficit to 31-6 late in the third. But that was it for the Hurricanes, who dropped their third consecutive game 33-7.

“It’s a disappointing result, but our team is playing more aggressively and with a lot more emotion,” Young said.

With eyes now set on the semi-final matchup against the second-place UNB Red Bombers, Young is hoping to take the positives from this game and translate them to a win in next weekend’s showdown in Fredericton.

“This game was a warm up for UNB,” he said. “The energy is there, we just have to make a few adjustments.”

The Red Bombers will host Holland College in semi-final action on October 29 at the BMO Centre. Kickoff time is yet to be decided.
