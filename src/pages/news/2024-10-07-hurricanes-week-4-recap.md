The football Hurricanes continued their destruction against the Saint John Falcons, keeping them winless once again and, this time, keeping them scoreless in a 44-0 win on Sunday in Charlottetown. It was the team’s last home game of the regular season.

Holland’s dominance started early with rookie defensive lineman Jack deVries (Annapolis Valley, N.S.) giving his squad offense possession with a defensive line pick and a punt and recovery by second-year quarterback Simon Hales (Victoria, B.C.), which led to a quarterback sneak by second-year receiver Wolf Sym (Tillsonburg, Ontario) that gave the ‘Canes a 6-0 lead (a conversion made it 7-0).

Second-year running back Ethan Godinho (Guelph, Ontario) scored a rushing touchdown to make it 14-0, with a conversion extending the team’s lead to 21-0. After an interception and more fantastic playmaking by second-year defensive back Mathis Blais (North Rustico, P.E.I.), rookie running back Pierce Saunders (St. Patricks, P.E.I.) scored a rushing touchdown to make it a 28-0 game, with rookie receiver Erron Beachey (North Bay, Ontario) adding another one plus a conversion for a 35-0 score. Another touchdown and a successful conversion by rookie receiver/returner Keegan Cardona (London, Ontario) sealed the deal for a final score of 44-0.

The Falcons dropped to 0-4 while the ‘Canes improved to 3-1 and are two points behind the Dalhousie Tigers for the league lead. Holland has two games left to chase Dalhousie, with their next one on Saturday, Oct. 12 in Fredericton, N.B. against the 1-3 UNB Reds.
