---

**Sunday, October 28, 2018. Charlottetown, PEI –** It’s been a long season for the Hurricanes, but in the play-off game in Fredericton this weekend, the team showed fans what they are made of. With 15 seconds left to play in regulation time, receiver Jarrett Walker caught a Brady Crowe pass to score a touchdown, and then, with only five seconds left, caught a pass for the 2-point conversion, allowing the ’Canes to force the Red Bombers into an exciting overtime come-from-behind win with a final score of 40-34.

The Bombers jumped out to an early 14-0 lead in the first quarter, much to the frustration of the ’Canes defence, who struggled to control the well-executed pass and run game of the UNB Fredericton Red Bombers.

An interception by Hurricanes defensive back Donovin Small sparked the ’Canes into action. Just at the end of first quarter, receiver Jarrett Walker caught a pass from Brady Crowe, and kicker Cruichshank added the single to make score 14-7 for Bombers.   

With six minutes gone in the second quarter, the Bombers went ahead 21-7, but the ’Canes kept working hard. Quarterback Brady Crowe worked the ball up the field with catches from Montes de Oca, Ross, Kaye-Mitchell and Nicholson, allowing Montes de Oca to rush into the end zone to make the score21-14, with a Cruichshank single at the three-minute mark of the second quarter.

In the third quarter, the Hurricanes offense pressed, and Connor Cruichshank scored a field goal, making the score 21-17 for the Bombers. But late in the third and early in the fourth, the Bombers scored two majors, making the score 34-17 with 8:19 to play in the game.

At the 4:23 mark, things were looking bleak for the Hurricanes, who were defending deep in their end when defensive back Donovin Small made a tackle and ripped the ball from a Bomber receiver and ran about 60 yards to score.With renewed energy, the ’Canes defense was stoked by Small and the score went to 34-24.

The Hurricanes defense held the Bombers deep in their end, forcing the Bombers’ punter to concede a two-point safety, bringing the score to 34-26 with 1:17 left to play in game.

The Hurricanes offense, who had been playing strong all day, once again was called into action, and a beautiful pass and run play by TeShaun Tran to receiver Kaye-Mitchell caught the Bombers by surprise and picked up 50 yards.

Hurricanes quarterback Brady Crowe hit receiver Jarrett Walker with a pass and a major with 15 seconds left, and with 5 seconds to play, Walker converted a short pass for the 2 point conversion, forcing a tie at 34-34 with five seconds left in the game forcing the game into overtime.

In overtime, the Hurricanes got the ball first, and Adam Shambemiradam caught a pass in the end zone making the score 40 to 34.


The Bombers had a chance for the win, but a rejuvenated Hurricanes defence, led by linebacker Alex Rose and a big stop by defensive end Tyler Hobbs on 3rd and 5 sealed a well-executed come from behind win for the ’Canes

Coach Young was very proud of the resilience of his young team.


“The guys did not panic. Offence had a great week in practice, and it showed in their game today.Our defence struggled to contain the Bombers’ offence, and in the fourth quarter and in overtime they dug in,” he said.

“This group of young men showed a lot of character today and have been working hard to prove to the league that they are a good football team. We have come from behind most of the year, and today the coaches and players worked hard to earn this victory. We can't wait to see Dal next week.”

The Hurricanes will play the Dalhousie Tigers in the Atlantic Football League next weekend in Halifax.
