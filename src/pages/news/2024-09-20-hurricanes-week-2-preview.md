After an incredible start to the 2024 AFL season which saw the football Hurricanes make a comeback for the ages against the defending champions, the University of New Brunswick (UNB) Reds, they are set to keep the momentum going with another big matchup this Sunday.

It’ll be a battle between the only two undefeated teams left as the Dalhousie Tigers come across the Confederation Bridge after a whopping 69-0 home-opening win against the Saint John Falcons last Saturday, Sept. 14. Leading the charge in the routing were Ethan Lord on offense, Daniel Forbes on defense, and Liam Masner on special teams, with all three being named the week one AFL Players of the Week for Dalhousie.

As for the ‘Canes, second-year kicker/punter Simon Hales (Victoria, B.C.) returned to AFL competition making it clear that he’s in to help chase after a championship, and rookie receiver/returner Keegan Cardona (London, ON) also made a statement in his AFL debut as his touchdown last Saturday was one of many factors in the big comeback victory. There’s also fourth-year quarterback Hunter Prus (Bedeque, P.E.I.) and third-year linebacker Owen MacLeod, who were each named Holland’s week one AFL Athletes of the Week alongside Hales.MacLeod was also named the Hurricanes Athlete of the Week.

Game time is at 1 p.m. This Sunday is “Family Day” which means there will be a family ticket special (2 adults, 2 kids for $20, must be pre-purchased by Friday at 4pm by emailing dccudmore@hollandcollege.com), free admission to all minor football players wearing their Football PEI jersey, and free admission for all Holland College students and staff (must show Holl Pass at entry).
