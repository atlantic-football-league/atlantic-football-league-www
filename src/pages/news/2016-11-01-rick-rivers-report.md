In less than perfect first half weather, the year of the football tiger continued as the black and gold distanced the UNB Saint John Seawolves, 35-0.  During a drizzly first quarter, the Dalhousie receivers had a few drops but the run game came to the forefront!  Ever consistent, running back Zach Leger provided the fire power scoring 3 touchdowns on 13 carries for 153 yards.  Leger's versatility was again witnessed as he made defenders miss, ran a few over or would bounce off and sprint away on majors from 42, 28 and 10 yards out.

In light of the first half wet, QB Hunsley was more than adequate completing 13 of 22 to six different receivers for 131 yards for one td and no picks.  Guillaume Bernier had Dal's only aerial major on the day.

Punter/placekicker Wilson had another good game keeping the Seawolves deep with help from great downfield tackling from the specialty teams.  Wilson contributed to the scoring with 3 of 4 pats, 1 field goal and a rouge.  The D forced UNBSJ into 2 safeties.

They say D wins championships and hopefully that will be witnessed next week.  They pitched another shutout Saturday evening, their fourth in seven games.  Only as strong as their weakest link, these tough tigers have only allowed an unbelievable 3.1 points per game.

Top D performers in this weekend tilt were: Jack Chaisson with 6 tackles and one sack, Liam Manson 3 ts, 1 sack and 1 fumble recovery and Josh Bordage with 5 ts and 1 fr.  A pleasant surprise was seeing David Parkhill back in action and contributing 2 sacks and 2 tackles.

Needless to say chairman, Jim Wilson is ecstatic to be going to the AFL for the second straight year.  He commented, "Coach Haggett has done a wonderful job of keeping our players focused and we can't wait for the championship game against Holland College next week."

Three trumpeting Ninja Turtles; coach Haggett's brothers, Jonathan and Matthew and friend Claire Cummings did a great job with their rendition of 'O Canada and have promised to come back to lead the Tiger's charge next weekend.  The black and gold will be seeking to avenge the 32-24 loss to the Holland College Hurricanes in the 2015 final.

The Tigers defeated the Hurricanes in their home and away tilts this year.  But as they say, "any given Sunday".  Such was the case on Saturday as third seeded Holland College edged the second place UNBF Red Bombers, 15-10.
