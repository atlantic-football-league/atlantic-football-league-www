In a rematch of last week's contest, the UNB Red Bombers were defeated by the Holland Hurricanes 32-21, Sunday at BMO Centre.

In a game that was postponed 24 hours due to high winds, a battle for field position was the name of the game.

Both teams relied heavily on their running games for the first time this season, mainly because of injuries to Bombers wideout Josh Blnachard and Hurricanes deep threat Jeff Hiller. 

The Hurricanes opened up the scoring early when Carson Halliwell broke free on a 30 yard run to put them up 7-0.

The Bombers countered on their next drive thanks to Alex's Dee scrambling ability and big gains by brusing back Turner Sturgeon. Jesse Hazell found the endzone from one-yard out and Mitch McCoy kicked a 32-yard field goal shortly after to give the Bombers a 10-7 lead at the end of the first quarter. 

The Bombers continued to apply relentless presure, Kofi Bubar recorded two sacks, forcing Holland College to concede a safety. On the next Red Bombers drive, Hazell broke free on his most impressive run of the season tp increase the Bombers lead to 19-7.

Halliwell scored his second touchdown right before the end of the first half and thats when things started to fall apart for the Bombers.

Hurricanes deffensive end Josh Palmer picked off a tipped Alex Dee pass and Canes QB Anton SIanchuck made the most of ithe turnover; scoring on a 20 yard bootleg.

The Hurricanes defence pounced on another turnover just minutes later, strip sacking Dee and returning it for a touchdown to put Holland up 28-19. 

Following the drive, Dee was knocked out of the game, which allowed freshamn Pat Mollins to see his frst action of the season. His efforts to lead the comeback were not enough and the Hurricanes took the win 32-21.

With the loss, the Bombers fall to 2-2 while the Hurricanes improve to 4-0.

The Bombers are back in action this Saturday when they travel to Halifax to take on the Dalhousie Tigers, the Hurricanes will be on the road versus the UNBSJ Seawolves. Both kickoffs are slated for 7 p.m.
