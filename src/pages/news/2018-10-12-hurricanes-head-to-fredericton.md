**Thursday, October 11, 2018. Charlottetown-** The Holland College Hurricanes football team is coming off a couple of losses to the Dalhousie Tigers, but they are looking forward and know where they need to improve, said head coach Ross Young.

“We need to work on our ability to score and execute in the red zone. Our defence needs to shut down the run game. We started strong and we finished strong last week, but we need to sustain drives, and control time of possession,” he said.

Quarterback Michael Petroschke agreed.

“We weren’t clicking like we know we can last weekend, it felt like one step forward and two steps back,” he said.

Wide receiver Chris Leblanc knows what they need to work on.

“We need to be better on the offensive side of the ball and come together as an offensive.”

As for the defensive side of the ball, Leblanc had nothing but good things to say.

“The D plays big every game for us. We need to step up.”

The team is heading to Fredericton on Saturday upbeat and looking forward to showing the league what they can do after a great week of work.

Coach Young says the Fredericton Red Bombers are well coached and will be a tough opponent.

“We will be playing the Bombers for the next two weeks, so we will get to know each other pretty well,” he said.

“If the standings don’t change much we will be playing Fredericton in the semi-final, too.”

“By then, it’s going be some great football to watch.

Saturday’s game will be webcast by Bell. To watch the game online go to [http://player.communitylive.ca/Player/GetEvent/4489](http://player.communitylive.ca/Player/GetEvent/4489).
