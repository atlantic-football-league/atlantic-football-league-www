In what was a defensive battle for over three quarters. The Tigers(3-2) exploded for 18 points in the fourth quarter to defeat the undefeated Holland College Hurricanes(5-0), 22-8. 

The Hurricanes had been riding a sixteen home undefeated streak but Dal's vaunted defence guided by head coach Wetmore kept Holland College off balance all day.  Two interceptions by Jordan Stirling along with ten tackles led the black and gold D.  MacKenzie Inglis added a pick and four tackles and the defensive front four lead by David Parkhill and Emmanuel Gilbert saw the Hurricane QBs sacked and hurried on numerous occasions.

The Tigers only weak defensive time came after Rob Wilson scored a point on a missed 22 yard FG.  The Hurricanes would march 75 yards and Anton Sianchuk would connect with Steve Knapton from the 18.  HC's 2 point convert was thwarted making the half time score 6-1 for the Hurricanes.

A safety by Holland and a successful Wilson FG made the score 8-4 at three quarter time.  The Tigers' 0 came alive in the 4th Q, ignited by three Hurricane turnovers, 2 on INTs and one on downs, after being stopped on a fake punt.

Quarterback Nick Hunsley had a strong game completing 22/31 for 231 yards with two TD strikes.  One went to Gullimae Bernier from 20 yards out and the second to Alex Bayne from the 15.

Wilson, D's leading scorer on the day, added another FG, a 32 yard single on a beauty punt and two PATs, making the final 22-8.

Holland College, two time consecutive AFL champs, finish first and will host UNBSJ in one semi-final while Dal finish second and will host the UNBF Red Bombers at Huskies' Stadium on Saturday afternoon, October 31st at 2pm in the other semi.  The AFL final will be played on November 7th.
