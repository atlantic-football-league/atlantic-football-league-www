title: "Rick Rivers’ Report: Balanced D, O and ST Highlight Dal’s 30-0 Victory"

The Dalhousie Tigers’ game versus UNBSJ was somewhat pedestrian in nature and I am sure the circumstances had something to do with it.  The Seawolves bus broke down in Oxford on their way to a seven o’clock start at Wickwire Field.  The black and gold were thrown off their game day routine having to wait until after nine for the tilt to begin.  But it must have been even worse for the blue and white stranded on a smoky bus.  Because of a community curfew, the Tigers would triumph in a time shortened game, 30-0.  

For the Tigers the game almost had a disastrous start as former Tiger team MVP, now a Seawolf, Rob Wilson, and son of Dal football chair, Jim Wilson, picked off an errant Chris Duplisea pass and had a more than adequate return.  Fortunately for Dal, the Seawolves were called on a penalty and Dal maintained possession.  

The ground game produced the Tigers first TD as Zacchary Kuhn went a straight eight yards for the major. Malcolm Gascoigne made the convert for a 7-0 lead.  The defence which played well for the entire game captured a safety.  Gascoigne added more points on a 39 yard strike from Duplisea on a sideline streak, plus another extra point.  The Tigers ended the half up 16-0.

A shout out to Saint John QB, Carter Posovad who kept on ticking after numerous sacks and knockdowns by Dalhousie’s front seven.  By fan reaction the play of the game had to go to rocket Samuel Jennings-Lindsay on a perfectly timed blitz that levelled Posovad and a blocking back simultaneously. Jennings-Lindsey led all tacklers with 5, while Niko Davies, Connor Manson and Jesse Legault had 4, 3 and 3 respectively.

Another shout out to the dedicated Tiger fans who set through cold and drizzle after returning from a two hour delay.  Oh, and another shout out to the huddled mass of cheerleaders who continue their exuberant spirit.  They sure had fun at halftime with a long version of Sweet Caroline.  

The two Zacks, Leger and Kuhn, proved exciting on punt returns while Kuhn had a good day running (12/80).  Jason Watts (6/30) again worked well in rotation at RB while Vid Feher showed he is not lacking as a runner on a 44 yard run in the fourth Q after a Blake Rowe interception.

Second half scoring started on a Duplisea TD toss to Alistair Chauhan of 19 yards.  And for the second time in as many weeks, Gordon Brown had a pick six as he outraced everyone down the sideline for the 63 yard major.  Gascoigne converted both, rounding out the score to Tigers 30, Seawolves no score.

The Tigers, in first place with a perfect 5-0 record will be in Saint John to face the same Seawolves this Saturday with a loyal group of fans, hopefully cheering them on to a perfect regular season record.  On October 27th, the Atlantic Football League playoffs will commence with the Tigers playing the fourth place, UNBSJ at Wickwire Field at one o’clock.
