All of Dalhousie’s teams (O,D,ST) executed better than Holland College in what was the wild, windy, wet and weird weather of the Atlantic Football League’s tenth anniversary championship.  The Dal Tigers completed their second undefeated championship season in three years with a 27-3 victory over the Holland College Hurricanes in what was a near hurricane.

Dalhousie opened the scoring in the second minute, as Eric Purcell fell on an errant high snap to the punter for the touchdown which Malcolm Gascoigne converted.  The Tiger D forced a Hurricane safety and a 27 yard Gascoigne field goal left Dal up 12-0, at halftime.

QB Chris Duplisea connected with Jack Underhill on a 22 yard TD late in the third which Turner Kinal converted.  Earlier in the Q, Gascoigne picked up a single on a missed 37 yard field goal.  A William Kenneford INT near center field stopped one of Holland’s drives.  Later Dal gave up a safety and a punt single by Matthew Kaye-Mitchell provided the Hurricanes only scoring.

A torrential downpour opened the fourth Q and lasted the remainder of the game.  Robbie Holland’s fumble recovery of a ball that slipped out of Brady Crowe’s hand while scrambling midway through the 4th, set up a 28 yard major by Zacchary Kuhn.  Kinal made the point after, leaving the final score at 27-3.

Head coach Haggett was very proud of his team’s total effort and gave the game ball to well respected former Halifax West High School and Provincial coach, Dave Kelly, the Tiger’s new DC in 2018.

The Dalhousie Tigers graduate eight players this season.  All of whom could be potential league all-stars come voting time.  They include: Giovanni Holmes, Allistair Chauhan, Zack Leger, Guillaume Bernier, Chad Kirkhus, Samuel Lindsay-Jennings, Tommy Panther, Jesse Legault and Max Martin.  But coach Haggett can be reassured that his returning 47 can’t wait to fill their spots.  The success the Tigers have experienced, especially over the past three years will also bode well for new talent coming to Tiger country!

CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL WHO HAVE COMMITTED TO MAKING THIS TIGER FAMILY SO UNIQUE AND SUCCESSFUL OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS AND LET’S MAKE THIS COMING 10TH SEASON THE MOST REMARKABLE EVER!  EVEN MORE MEMORABLE THAN THE WEATHER UNDER WHICH YOU WON THE 2018 AFL TITLE!   GO TIGERS!!
