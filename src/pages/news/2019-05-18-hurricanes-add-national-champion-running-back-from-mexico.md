It’s been a big week for Marco Briones. Last Friday winning the ONEFA (National Organization for Student American Football) national championship in Mexico with the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León Tigres (Monterrey), and today he’s committed to joining the Holland Hurricanes men’s football team.

Briones, a running back from Nuevo Leon, Mexico, looks forward to making the move to Canada this fall.  He previously attended high school in Laredo, Texas where he studied and played football at the United South High School.

“What made me want to enroll at Holland College is the Sport & Leisure Management program that the school has to offer.  Being able to work towards my career goals while playing football for the Hurricanes made my decision to attend Holland College easy.”

Briones was the captain of his high school varsity team for two years while also being named All-District and All-City.  He looks to make an immediate impact with the Hurricanes this fall.

“I think my strongest attributes are my physical strength and a strong football IQ. I can be versatile and play the receiver position, plus block as a full back.  As a player, I feel my desire to win is my biggest attribute I can take to the field.”

Marco will join his cousin, Angel Briones, who currently works with the Hurricanes as the team’s offensive line coach.

“I am confident Marco will make an instant impact on our roster, while opening doors for players from Mexico to consider Canada as an option to study and play collegiate football,” he shared.

“Marco coming to PEI is special to me; we are very close family members.  We’ve lived together and shared many great memories – I look forward to creating more great memories together with the Hurricanes.”

Offensive coordinator, Owen MacWilliams, is happy to add an experienced running back to the Hurricanes roster.

“Marco is an all-around athlete who has great academic aspirations.  Coming from a university program he brings a veteran presence that will help our young team on the field.”

The Hurricanes, the 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015 Atlantic Football League champions, will begin their 2019 regular season on Saturday, September 14 when they visit the University of New Brunswick (UNB) in Fredericton at 7pm.
