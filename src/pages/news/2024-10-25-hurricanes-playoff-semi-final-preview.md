The football Hurricanes are set to wage an all-out war against the UNB Reds in AFL semifinal action on Saturday, Oct. 26 in Fredericton, N.B. With the season series tied 1-1 and Holland being routed 51-2 in the last match between the two teams on Oct. 12; football fans will be treated to a game for the ages at the BMO Centre.

Both teams finished the regular season tied for second in the standings with 3-3 records, with the Reds claiming the tiebreaker and home-field advantage for the semifinals. While UNB has the most recent momentum thanks to a 58-20 win against the Saint John Falcons last weekend, Holland shouldn’t be counted out entirely as they recently came incredibly close to an upset against the league-leading Dalhousie Tigers but fell short in overtime 31-28.

If the Hurricanes win on Saturday, they will have a chance to get back at Dalhousie in the AFL Championship Game on November 2 in Halifax.

It’s been since 2015 that the ‘Canes have won an AFL championship, and they have two semifinal losses and a playoff DNQ in the last three years.

Saturday’s game time is at 1 p.m. and can be watched live at[www.youtube.com/@unbreds](http://www.youtube.com/@unbreds).
