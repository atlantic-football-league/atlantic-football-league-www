title: Hurricanes travel to Saint John for AFL season opener
location: Charlottetown, PE

---
The Holland Hurricanes football team travels to Saint John for a rematch of last season’s championship game against the UNB Saint John Seawolves this Saturday at Canada Games Place at 4 p.m.

Heading into this season the reigning Atlantic Football League champion Hurricanes has experienced its usual high turnover of players, which is to be expected due to the relatively short duration of the college’s academic programs. Gone are running back Jordan Blizzard, who was the star of last year’s championship game, and the team’s defensive MVP Garvin Cius, who is now playing with Acadia Axemen. Returning veterans include team MVP Cardell Rolle, quarterback Christian Hackney, receiver Jeff Hillier, linebacker Alex Fitzgerald, linemen Owen MacWilliams and Andrew Pidgeon, rookie of the year Eugene McMinns, and kicker/defensive back Jay Dearborn. A number of talented rookies are vying for starting positions. The team has added size up front, on both sides of the ball, and is deep and talented at receiver. Running back Jamaal Storr looked strong in preseason action against Maine Maritime Academy.

Last season’s Offensive Coordinator Andrew Hickey has taken over as Head Coach from Mark MacDougall. Sean Hickey returns as QB coach, Ben Parsons as RB coach, and Dennis Sweet is back as offensive line coach. Additions to the coaching staff include Defensive Coordinator John Thomson, and assistants Doug Crossman, Steve Letner, Paul Walsh and Zack Nixon.

Hickey said the team is looking forward to going up against the Seawolves.

“The Seawolves were strong throughout last season, so we know this game is going to be hard-fought,” he said. “Don’t forget, they beat us twice during the regular season last year. The players and coaches are excited about the game.”

The ‘Canes return to their home field at UPEI Canada Games Place September 21 at 1 p.m. Fans are encouraged to join the Football Booster Club and follow the team on Facebook.
