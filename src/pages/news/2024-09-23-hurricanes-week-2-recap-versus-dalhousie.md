The Hurricanes football team went from experiencing the highest of highs at their season opener last weekend to the what could have been in this past Sunday’s home game, losing heartbreakingly to the Dalhousie Tigers 24-21.

Holland had a solid start, taking a 7-0 lead thanks to a touchdown by second-year receiver Keiler Purcell (Mineville, N.S.) early in the first quarter.

In the second quarter, Dalhousie threw a touchdown to tie the game 7-7 and only minutes later took a 14-7 lead. A field goal in the closing seconds before halftime had the Tigers leading 17-7 going into the second half.

In the third quarter, a bad snap for a punt by the Tigers was recovered by second-year receiver Zac Toner (Cornwall, P.E.I.) which led to the ‘Canes offense taking over at the 30-yard line and rookie receiver Erron Beachey (North Bay, Ontario) scoring a touchdown to close the gap to 17-14. Later, a missed field goal attempt by Dalhousie was returned for 110-yards by Keegan Cardona for yet another touchdown, giving the ‘Canes a 21-17 lead going into the fourth quarter.

After an intense final quarter, a touchdown in the closing minute by Dalhousie sealed the deal, handing Holland their first loss of the season. The Tigers now remain undefeated at 2-0 while the ‘Canes are 1-1.

Catch the Hurricanes back in action next Saturday, Sept. 28 as they head to Saint John, N.B. to play the 0-2 Saint John Falcons at the Canada Games Stadium at 2 p.m. It’ll be the first game between the two teams this season. The Falcons lost 69-0 to Dalhousie and 51-7 to UNB, so they’ll be eager to say “third time’s the charm” in their third game next Saturday.

The ‘Canes next home games is on Sunday, October 6 versus Saint John at the UPEI Alumni Canada Games Place in Charlottetown; kickoff is at 1pm.
