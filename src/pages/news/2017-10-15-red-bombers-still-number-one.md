UNB Red Bomber 35 - Dalhousie Tigers 31

The UNB Red Bombers (4-1) remain on top of the AFL standings with a win over the defending champion Dalhousie University Tigers in a game on Sunday in Halifax that came right down to the wire. The Red Bombers caught the Tigers off guard and were up 14 -1 in the first quarter, but the Tigers came back to make it 22-14 for Dal going into half time. With 1 minute left in the game and Dal ahead 31-28 UNB ran the ball in for the major to make it 35-31 for UNB after the PA. Not giving up, Dal were deep in UNB territory in the dying seconds of the game when they turned the ball over on downs, and UNB took a knee to down the ball and end the game.

The UNB Red Bombers are on the road again next Sat as they visit the UNBSJ Seawolves.
