The Bombers fell to the Dalhousie Tigers 31-20 yesterday in a light night rainy game in Halifax. Splitting the season series with the Tigers. Given that Dal defeated us by 11 points versus us winning in Sept by 6 they were awarded the Trophy as well as the higher seating for playoffs. 

In other AFL Action the Holland College Hurricanes defeated the UNBSJ Seawolves 40-6 and with the win the Hurricanes clinched first place in the regular season and the Jack Irving Trophy. 

Playoff match ups have been set as well as HC will host UNBSJ in one semi while our Bombers will travel back to Halifax to face the Tigers in the other semifinal.
