Garyth McLean, of Miramichi, New Brunswick, is set to attend Holland College this fall; he’ll be studying in the Welding Fabrication program while also playing football for the Hurricanes.

The slot back/wide receiver impressed many at the recent Hurricanes Spring Identification Camp in Cornwall, PEI at the Terry Fox Sports Complex, as well as at a recent recruiting day in Miramichi, NB.

Head coach, Stephen Letner, had the following to say about adding McLean to the roster.

“We’re looking forward to utilizing Garyth’s talents and abilities this season on the field. We’ll look to him to contribute immediately on our roster; he impressed everyone this spring with his offensive capabilities and we’re happy to have him join our team.”

McLean last played with the James M. Hill High School Tommies where he was the Miramichi Annual River-Bowl Most Valuable Player; he also served on the high school’s student council for the last two years.

“I set high standards for myself,” shared McLean.  “I’m constantly pushing myself to give everything I have.  My speed and decision making are my strengths; I feel I’m at my best in pressure situations.”

It was the trade offerings at Holland College that attracted McLean to enroll.

“I was very interested in the trade programs that Holland College has to offer,” he said.  “I decided to enroll in Welding Fabrication as I felt it was a good fit for me, and sets myself up for a career upon graduation.”

The Hurricanes 2018 season ended with a loss to the Dalhousie Tigers in the Atlantic Football League championship game; McLean is focused on helping his new team have a strong season in 2019.

“I’m going to play with speed and the willingness to work hard every minute that I’m on that field.  We’re going to show everyone what Holland College Football is all about.”

The Holland Hurricanes will begin the 2019 AFL regular season on September 14, 2019.

Later this month, the Hurricanes will host the first-ever Hurricanes Football Academy.  The Academy, led by players and coaches from the Hurricanes, is open to interested boys and girls ages 6-18.

The 6-12 group will run from 5:30-6:45pm, while the 13-18 group takes place from 7-8:15pm.

The ‘Canes will also be hosting the Hurricanes Football Combine on Sunday, April 28, also at the Holland College Centre for Community Engagement.  Men and women football players ages 16-24 are welcome to sign up at no-charge.

The Hurricanes training staff will be testing players in a variety of physical tests while also offering information sessions on Hurricanes Football and the academic offerings at Holland College; the event takes place from 9am-2pm.
