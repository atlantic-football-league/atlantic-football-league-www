title: "Rick Rivers’ Report: Duplisea Leads Tigers"

ABC’s Wild World of Sport of the 1970's talked about the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.  Dal football probably experienced both in Saturday’s near loss to the UNB Red Bombers.  After being up 18-3 at halftime and 27-3, 10 minutes into the 3rd Q, the thrill of victory seemed imminent.  But NO, as agony unfolded for the next 18 minutes and for the coaches’ post game analysis.

The Tigers scored with less than two minutes remaining to cover the deficit and win 34-31 in a nail-bitter.  D, O and ST were agonizing and ugly as the Red Bombers rebounded like the 3rd Q Tigers of last week.  

UNB’s first series of the game saw their wide open receiver drop a sure TD bomb.  But QB Greg Brown caught fire hitting seriously open receivers for long gains and majors during the agony period.  The Bombers had the Tigers reeling in every department, as they recovered 2 of 3 short kickoffs.  No wrap up caused missed tackles and added to the agony period, as UNB ball carriers had countless yards after first contact.  The Reds scored 28 unanswered points to lead 31-27.

But the black and gold did win!  Tiger QB, Chris Duplisea, lead the Tigers to victory as he threw 4 TD passes completing 20/35 for 324 yards with no picks.  His elusive running picked up two important first downs, but his pocket presence, movement and his passing in face of pressure was the difference.  Morgan Laws snagged 2 major catches while Malcom Gascoigne and Matt Lindsay had the others.  Turner Kinal made all 4 converts and Gascoigne was good on one of two field goals.  Sam Jennings-Lindsay led all defenders with 8 tackles and a sack, while Connor Manson had 6 Ts and 2 sacks and Jesse Legault had 4 and 2.

This homecoming weekend,  Dalhousie will face the Holland Hurricanes (2-0) in a game that could determine first place and home field advantage for the AFL Championship in early November.  Aside from what should be a great game,  Decade Greats from the 50's, 60's and 70's will be honoured at half time during Dalhousie’s 200th anniversary year.  Come rally Dal and reminisce about the past and watch the new area Tigers make history.
