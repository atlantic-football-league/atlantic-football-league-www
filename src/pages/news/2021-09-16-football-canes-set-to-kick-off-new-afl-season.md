The Holland Hurricanes will begin the 2021 Atlantic Football League (AFL) regular season on the road this Sunday when they travel to Fredericton, New Brunswick to take on the University of New Brunswick (UNB) Red Bombers. Kickoff is scheduled for 1pm.

Sunday’s game is a rematch from the 2019 AFL championship game, a game that saw the Red Bombers mount a charge in the final minutes of the game and claim the 29-26 victory.

“It has been a long time coming but we are very excited to step on the field this Sunday against UNB,” shared Aaron MacIsaac, Hurricanes head coach.

“The guys have put in a pile of work during training camp and they are ready. The coaching staff has done an excellent job of prepping and developing schemes that will put every player in a position to be successful.”

Returning defensive back, Hayden Machacynski, is ready to finally return to the field after the 2020 season was cancelled due to the covid-19 pandemic.

“I am extremely blessed and excited to get back with my teammates after two years away from the game,” he shared.

His teammate, Tyler Hobbs, shares his excitement and recognizes the importance of Sunday after dropping the 2019 final.

“All the veterans have a chip on their shoulder for this game,” he shared. “It’s going to be a hard fought football game and I can’t wait to get it started.”
