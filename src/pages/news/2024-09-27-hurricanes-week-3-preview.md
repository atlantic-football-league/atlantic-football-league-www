The 1-1 Hurricanes football team hopes to get back into the win column this weekend after losing heartbreakingly in the dying minutes against Dalhousie last Sunday at home.

This Saturday, Holland heads to Saint John, N.B. to play the Saint John Falcons, who are winless after two games and have only scored seven points while losing 69-0 to Dalhousie and 51-7 to UNB to start the season on the road.

Keep an eye out for AFL Week 2 Hurricanes Players of the Week, second-year receiver Keiler Purcell (Mineville, N.S.), second-year defensive back Mathis Blais (North Rustico, P.E.I.), and rookie receiver/returner Keegan Cardona (London, ON), to make sure their squad bounces back from last Sunday’s late-game mishap.

The game will be available to watch live at[www.ao.live/falcons](http://www.ao.live/falcons).
