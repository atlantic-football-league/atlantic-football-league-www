location: Halifax, NS

Battling against the wind and a big UNB Saint John team, the Dalhousie Football Club found rhythm in the second half to beat the Seawolves 28 – 13.

Overcoming first half struggles, the Tigers scored early in the third quarter and held off a UNB Saint John comeback to move to 2 – 0 early in the season.

With four interceptions on the day, the Tigers were able to hold back the Quarterback tandem of Trevor Harrison and Sean Galbraith to seal the victory.

Veteran Joe Ghosn picked off Harrison to start the game, before a quick score by the Tigers saw Quarterback Matt Shannon connect with Darcy Chant on a 6-yard touchdown play.

The Tigers added a rouge and a safety to take a 10 – 0 lead heading into the second quarter, overcoming a blocked field goal by the Seawolves to keep the home team scoreless.

A strong wind played a factor all day, and as the teams switched ends to start the second quarter the Seawolves took advantage and scored a touchdown off a blocked punt, before adding their own rouge and field goal for a slim 11- 10 lead at the half.

The second half would belong to the Tigers, scoring twice in the first five minutes on a touchdown throw to Alex Baynes and a nifty touchdown run by Trae Colley.

Holding a 13-point lead, the Tigers settled into a rhythm and added to the lead through a 34-yard Field Goal by Sebastien Ayangma, heading into the fourth quarter with a commanding 28 – 11 lead.

Late in the game the Tigers would concede a safety with kicker Matt McKenney managing the clock but being brought down in his own end zone and gifting 2-points to the Seawolves.

A late interception by Carter Sopik, his second of the afternoon, all but ended any Seawolves comeback and the Tigers would force a turnover on downs on the last Saint John drive.

The 28 – 13 victory means the Tigers will play the Holland College Hurricanes Week 3 in a battle of the two undefeated teams, with the winner going top of the standings.
