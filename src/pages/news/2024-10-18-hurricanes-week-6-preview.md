The football Hurricanes are entering an important matchup this Sunday on the raod as the 2024 AFL playoffs quickly approach.

Holding a 3-2 record and sitting second in the standings, Holland has a chance to clinch home-field advantage in the playoffs this Sunday but have two things to keep in mind. One, the 2-3 UNB Reds, who are two points behind the Hurricanes, will face off against the winless, 0-5 Saint John Falcons on Saturday. Two, Holland’s opponent on Sunday are the undefeated, 5-0 Dalhousie Tigers.

If UNB wins on Saturday, the Hurricanes must win or else they will have to head to Fredericton, N.B. for the 2024 AFL playoff semifinals. If UNB loses, the result between Holland and Dalhousie won’t matter, but a win would be both monumental and a big confidence boost.

The Hurricanes had a rough go last weekend with a 51-2 loss to UNB on Saturday, Oct. 12, so we’ll see if the pressure of everything going into this Sunday will play a factor in the team’s performance.

Game time is at 4 p.m. at the Wickwire Field.The game can be viewed live at[https://www.ao.live](https://www.ao.live/).
