The Holland Hurricanes return home on Saturday to host the University of New Brunswick (UNB) Red Bombers in Atlantic Football League (AFL) regular season action at 1pm at the Alumni Canada Games Place in Charlottetown, PEI.



The ‘Canes enter Saturday at 1-2 and in third place in the AFL standings while the Red Bombers sit atop the standings at 3-0.  This is the second time the Hurricanes have faced UNB this season; they opened the season in Fredericton to a 28-17 loss on September 14.



“As we hit the mid-point of our regular season, we feel we are starting to turn a corner,” shared head coach, Steve Letner.  “It’s going to be a great game on Saturday versus UNB, and I believe this is the week the flood gates are going to open for us offensively.  We’re going to keep moving forward and improving our program.”



After the season opening loss the Hurricanes bounced back with a 12-7 victory at home over the University of New Brunswick-Saint John (UNBSJ) Seawolves the following week.  Last Saturday the ‘Canes dropped a road game in Halifax, NS to the Dalhousie University Tigers by a score of 28-3.



Defensive back, Daniel Nkonkomalimba, feels the Hurricanes are growing stronger each day.



“I am excited to see how our team has molded now that we’re halfway through the season, especially with our key players back on the field from injury.”



This is the second of three regular season home games for the Hurricanes; their final will take place on Saturday, October 5 when they host the Dalhousie Tigers at 2pm.  The top two teams in the standings following the regular season will host home semi-final playoff games.



First-year receiver, Kymani Simpson has had a strong start to the year as the ‘Canes top receiver.  He’s continuing to adjust to playing with the Hurricanes.



“I think our defense is the best in the league, and offensively we are capable of doing big things this season,” shared Simpson.  “Right now, teams think we’re the underdogs in the league but we’ll be playing with a chip on our shoulders.  We have to go out this game and show everyone how hungry we are to chase a championship.”



Last week the Hurricanes announced their Offensive and Defensive Players of the Week.  Simpson was recognized for his strong offensive contribution to the team versus Dalhousie.



Simpson made seven receptions on Saturday versus the Tigers for a total of 50 yards.  This season he’s made 17 receptions over three games of action, totaling 218 yards.



Defensively, AJ Fields was named the team’s Defensive Player of the Week.



Fields was a leader on the defensive side of the ball for the Hurricanes in Halifax, making life difficult for the Tigers offence during the entire game, causing them to adjust their game plan to avoid him when possessing the ball.
