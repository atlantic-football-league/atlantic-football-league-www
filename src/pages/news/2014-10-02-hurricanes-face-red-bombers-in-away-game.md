title: Hurricanes face Red Bombers in away game
location: Charlottetown, PE
---

The Holland Hurricanes football team is on the road this weekend to play the UNB Fredericton Red Bombers Saturday at the BMO field at 1 p.m. The Hurricanes go into the game undefeated at 3-0, while the Red Bombers’ record is 1-2.

In their previous meeting this season, the Hurricanes beat the Red Bombers 37-20; but Hurricanes head coach Andrew Hickey said with as much parity as there is in the Atlantic Football League, there are no foregone conclusions.

“As we saw last season, when the Hurricanes finished in last place and then went on to beat the UNB Saint John Seawolves to win the Moosehead Cup, anything can happen in this league,” he said.

The game will be live streamed. There will be a link to the web cast on the Hurricanes Facebook page. The Hurricanes play their next home game 1 p.m., Saturday, October 11, at UPEI Alumni Canada Games Place. For more information about the team, visit hcfootball.ca.
