The O and the D got a chance to introduce themselves to one another at training camp with a little 1 on 1 during the second practice on Sunday. "We've starting training camp with one of the best O Lines we’ve seen." -  Head Coach Dan McCullough

Camp continues all week under the lights from 8:00pm – 10:00pm each evening at BMO Centre field as student-players returning to school settle in. The UNB Red Bombers will host the Moncton Rush on Saturday Sept. 10 at 1:00pm at BMO Centre for UNB’s Orientation Week Game and the Club’s home opener. The game will be live streamed. More information on that later this week.
