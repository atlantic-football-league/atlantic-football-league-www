The Dal Tigers (2-0) took a commanding lead after the first leg of the 2-game Alumni Cup with a 39-0 win over the UNB Red Bombers (1-1) Saturday night.

Dal’s veteran squad (30 returnees) took full advantage of the young Bombers mistakes, scoring early as Dal blocked a Bombers punt and recovered the ball on the five yard line of UNB. On the Tigers first play from scrimmage, running back Zach Leger punched it in for the major. Rob Wilson added the extra point and it was 7-0 Dal early. 

After the blocked punt the Bombers controlled good field position in the first quarter and had their opportunities, including after an interception by Red Bombers Sebastian Hebert. However, with just over four minutes gone in the second quarter and with Dal deep in their own end, veteran Tigers QB Nick Hunsley was able to hit a 95 yard bomb to Louis Gauvin. The major score gave Dal a 13-0 lead, with a missed extra point.

Mistakes by the Bombers were costly against this Dal team. Shortly after the Dal score the Bombers turned the ball over deep in their own end and Dal hit a chip shot field goal to go up 16-0. Then later in the quarter a Bombers fumble again deep in their own end set up Dal for one final score before the half, giving them a commanding half time score of 23-0.

Early in the third quarter, pinned deep, the Bombers conceded a safety to make it 25-0. The Tigers’ Hunsley and Gauvin, who was dominate for the Tigers all night, connected one final time to make the score 32-0. Red Bombers QB Pat Mollins connected with Bombers veteran WR Luke McLeod for a 55 yard completion, and Bombers Jake McKay made a great interception, but alas a late interception by the Tigers was returned for the final score making it 39-0.

The final leg of the Alumni Cup goes this Saturday Oct 1st at BMO Field at 1pm.

This will also be the UNB Homecoming and the 6th Annual Tony Proudfoot Memorial Game. A special Red Bombers Reunion will recognize “The Jim Born Years 1971-1980”. During that period when Jim was HC, a remarkable 7 players went on to play in the CFL, and more players were drafted into the CFL than during any other period or under any other Red Bombers HC. A number of the former CFL players will be returning to Campus for the game this Saturday to honour Coach Born.
