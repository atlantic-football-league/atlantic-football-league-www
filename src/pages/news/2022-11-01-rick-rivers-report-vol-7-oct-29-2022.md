UNBF REDS, DALHOUSIE IS COMING!



It was an ideal fall evening for a football game. Mild with little wind as hundreds of spectators showed up to watch what was a defensive struggle, as the Tigers edged the Holland College Hurricanes, 18-12. After the game, head coach Kelly said, “an ugly win is better than a pretty loss. “ He credited the defence with the victory and was again frustrated with the team’s lack of composure regarding unnecessary penalties.



Dalhousie gave up an early safety touch to go down 0-2 to Holland. The B and G took the lead on a scintillating 70 yard punt return by Josh Hatfield and a PAT by Matthew Irvine to go up 7-2. Less than three minutes later, Hunter Prus combined with Kyle Cameron on a 65-yard pass and run TD, to give the Hurricanes a 7-9 lead at the half.



The Tigers had a good march early in the 3rd Q but the Hurricanes stymied Dal at the one yard line. The B and G D held Holland on their possession which led to a Tiger safety for a 9-9 score. Four minutes later, Dal QB, Noah Glover passed to Robbie Sneath for a 13-yard TD. Irvine’s convert had the Tigers up 18-9. A late FG by Holland made the final score 18-12.



The Tigers’ D was led by Mr. INT, Cameron McCormick with two and Logan Hillier with one. D lineman, Yasine Yassine, Mike MacKenzie and Christian Riley did a great job in the trenches and came up with a number of QB sacks. Both Mitchell Page and Javier Reyes Landry had good games running the ball for the Tigers.



The Dalhousie footballers are now headed to Fredericton to avenge their only loss of the season which was to the Reds. If the B and G are to defeat UNBF they will have to stop the power running of Daniel Freeze and contain the elusive moves of QB Hunter Sturgeon. The Tigers defeated the Reds in their first meeting of the year. If the Dal players keep their cool, composure, poise that will cut down their penalties and give the Tigers a great chance to win a third consecutive AFL title. Remember, ‘any given Sunday (Saturday)’.
