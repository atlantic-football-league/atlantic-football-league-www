title: Hurricanes Win First Game of the Season
---

**Sunday, September 16, 2018. CHARLOTTETOWN, PE-** The first game of the season for the Hurricanes proved to be close and exciting one for fans and players alike.

The Hurricanes held off a feisty and capable Sea Wolves team, who capitalized on two 4th quarter Hurricanes fumbles, leading to two majors, and forcing the Hurricanes defense to hold strong on their own 20 yard line with less than minute to play to seal the game.

The Hurricanes led throughout the game, and were up 22-3 when, late in the 4th quarter, they gave up two turnovers, which led to two scores by the Sea Wolves, making the game 22-17 with a minute to play in the game.

The Hurricanes defence was able to fend off the last minute drive by the Sea Wolves to seal the deal.

Quarterback Brady Crowe led the Hurricanes’ offence with a rushing 5-yard major of his own and a 30-yard passing touchdown score to receiver Allister Nicholson. Linebacker Javier Bolanos picked off a Sea Wolves pass on Saint John's 25-yard line and rushed into the Saint John zone scoring a major for the Hurricanes.

Place kicker Brennan Davis added the extra points. Hurricanes running back Rodrigo Montes de Oca rushed for 111 yards on the day and caught five passes for 30 yards. Receiver Adam Shambe had four receptions with his fellow receivers Jarrett Walker, Joey Boniface, Brennan Davis and Deon Reid helping with the Hurricanes passing game.

The big story of the day was the performance of the Hurricanes defence. Linebacker Alex Rose led the defense with five solo tackles and two sacks. Bassey Amba had two quarterback sacks and Mitchell Logan had two sacks and two solo tackles, while Bradley Lawton held the line.

Costly penalties and turnovers forced the Holland College defence to hold off a very fired up Saint John team.
 
Head coach Ross Young was pleased with his team's overall performance.

“Our team was tested today by a very good and revitalized football team in Saint John. Our defence was strong today and the players performed well.We were able to see many of our players in action on both sides of the ball, so the takeaways and teachable moments will be an important part of our preparation for our first game at home. Bad penalties and three turnovers almost cost us the game. We have to tighten up on our discipline and protect the ball better,” he said. “We will take the win and improve on our execution each week, one game at a time.”

This season promises to be interesting, with the Hurricanes playing each team in consecutive games. They play their first home game Saturday at 1 p.m. on MacAdam Field at UPEI Canada Games Alumni Place.
