The UNB Red Bombers traveled to Saint John last night and defeated the UNBSJ Seawolves  37 - 21 and the lights at Canada Games Stadium. 

Leading the way for the Bombers was third year All-Star Safety/Kicker Alex White who successfully kicked an onside kick to open the game. The Bombers drove down the field and Alex tossed the first score of the game on a fake field goal setting the tone for a dominate win in all three phases of the game. 

White would finish the game 3/3 on field goals 4/4 on point after tries and the aforementioned touchdown toss.

Quarterback Alex Dee tossed two touchdowns. One to each of his superstar wideouts- Josh Blanchard and Mitch McCoy. While Fullback Turner Sturgeon ran in the final score.
