**Wednesday, September 19, 2018. Charlottetown –** The rain came down on Tuesday night in Charlottetown, but that didn’t stop the Holland College Hurricanes football team from practicing as usual ahead of their home opener against the UNB Saint John Sea Wolves on Saturday.

The Hurricanes will be heading in with 1-0 record after defeating Saint John 22-17 last weekend on the road. The game was full of lessons learned, according to head coach Ross Young.

“We saw a lot of good things and there are things that we are working on tonight to get better at.”

“There were times where the offence left us backed up on our 15 to 20-yard line and our defence stood up and got the job done,” said Young.

Key contributors to that D-line were defensive tackle Bradley Lawton and defensive end Dennis Robler, who are ready to go for Saturday.

“The first half we were still getting it together, but by the second half we were off to the races,” said Lawton, who is a returning player to the team.

As for Robler, who was playing his first game of college ball, he loved every minute of it.

“We played a great game and just have to start stronger and leave it all out there.”

Young agreed and complimented the young defensive end.

“Robler is an explosive player. Our defence, led by LBs Alex Rose and Javier Bolaños, set the tone.”

Coach Young also said that discipline will be something to work on for Saturday.

“We took a lot of unnecessary penalties that almost cost us the game,” said Young.

As for Saturday’s lineup, the coach’s formula is quite simple.

“The guys that show up in practice, work hard, and execute their assignments will play in the games.”

Coach Young is very please with his coaching staff, many of whom are former Hurricanes.

Kickoff for the Hurricanes home opener is 1 p.m. on MacAdam field at UPEI Canada Games Alumni Place. All Holland College alumni and former Hurricanes are invited to attend the game.
