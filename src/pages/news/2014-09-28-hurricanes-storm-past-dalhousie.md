The Holland College Hurricanes extended their perfect record as they pushed past the Dalhousie Tigers 41-15 on Saturday afternoon at the UPEI Alumni Canada Games Place in Charlottetown.

Holland College improved to 3-0, while the Tigers dropped to 2-1.

Hurricanes head coach Andrew Hickey said a series of big plays gave his team the edge over Dalhousie.

“We adjusted to what they were giving us and took advantage of that. This week in practice, we focused on fixing our mistakes and special teams and it really paid off.”

The Tigers put the first points on the board midway through the first quarter. They marched down the field and receiver Darcy Chant capped off the drive with a one-yard touchdown catch.

Several possessions later, Hurricanes receiver Eugene McMinns recovered a kick on the Tiger’s goal line and quarterback Christian Hackney punched it in for the score to tie the game at seven.

Hurricanes running back Jamal Storr opened the second quarter with a 35-yard run and Jaylen McRae found the end zone to give Holland College the 14-7 lead.

McRae said he felt the weight of the team on his shoulders as he made defenders miss with his athletic quickness.

“I had to make it happen. My whole team is counting on me. It’s just another step closer to a win.”

On the next possession, the Tigers moved the ball deep in Hurricane’s territory, but they had to settle for an 11-yard field by Sebastien Ayangma.

Holland College led 14-10 at half time.

On the second half’s opening kickoff, Ayangma’s kick sailed into the end zone, giving the Tigers another point.

Midway through the third quarter, McRae returned a punt 70 yards and several plays later, Hackney found receiver Jeff Hillier at the back of the end zone.

The two teams changed possessions several times and neither team put up points, until a long punt by the Hurricanes pinned Dalhousie to their own one-yard line. The Tigers failed to move the ball and their punt was blocked by linebacker Alex Rose. The Hurricanes took over on the Tiger’s goal line and Hackney hit Owen McWilliams on a quick slant to put them ahead 28-15.

The Holland College defence wasn’t finished yet. They forced a safety and picked off a pass from Tigers quarterback Nick Hunsley, taking it to the Tiger’s goal line once more. Hackney would dive into the end zone for another score.

With three minutes left, Hurricane’s cornerback Brandon Whitman intercepted another pass, setting up a field goal to end the game.

Hackney said he was pleased with his team’s explosiveness on both sides of the ball.

“We finally broke that 40 point barrier and we minimized our mistakes, which was really good. It was a complete game from the whole team.”

The Hurricanes will try to keep their winning streak alive as they travel to Fredericton October 4 to face the UNB Red Bombers. The next Hurricanes home game is on Saturday, October 11 at 1 p.m. at UPEI Canada Games Alumni Place.
