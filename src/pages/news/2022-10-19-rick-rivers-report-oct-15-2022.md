“It Ain’t Over Till It’s Over”
 

Yogi Berra, a baseball Hall of Famer, made the title quote while managing the NY Mets.  His team came back to win the National League Pennant.  On the weekend, the Dalhousie Tigers went to Fredericton up 4 points for the Alumni Cup.  The UNBF Reds won the game, 28-5 to win the series after losing the first game to the Tigers, 29-25.  The Black and Gold may have lost the Cup but the most important game, the AFL title game is weeks away.  

 

Another colloquialism, this one from the NFL states, “on any given Sunday”.  This means any team is capable of beating any other. So,Tigers use the next few weeks of practice to reverse this past Saturday’s scenario.

 

The first half of play in Saturday’s game was ugly by both teams and awash with rain, drizzle and numerous fumbles.  The Reds gave up a safety touch to give the Tigers an early lead but UNB’s QB, Hunter Sturgeon scored to give the Reds a 6-2 halftime lead.  A Tigers’ punt was costly on the play as P\PK, Okyay Kepenek, was injured and the Reds assessed a roughing the kicker penalty on the play.  Later in the Q, the Reds lost the ball on a fumbled punt deep in their own end.  The Tigers came away with 3 points on a FG by Owen Hamilton White, making the score 8-5 at the end of the third Q.

 

The rain had ended at the half but the Tigers’ pass attack was non-existent throughout the game. The only highlight of the Dal O was the rugged running of Javier Reyes Landry who gained 84 yards on 19 carries while QB Noah Glover picked up 31 on 6 carries.  Meanwhile, the Reds ground attack became intense in the 4th Q led by John Freeze, Bryan Lee and Sturgeon.  Lee booted a 27 yard FG to go with the convert on Sturgeon’s second TD making the score, 18-5 UNBF.  A third six by Sturgeon on a one yard carry and Lee’s convert and his 12 yard FG made the final score, Reds 28 and Tigers 5. The Tigers’ D was led by Liam Chisari with 13 tackles, Riley Fitzpatrick 12, Logan Miller and Mike MacKenzie, 7 each and Jeremy Miller with 6 hits.  

 

Kudos to head physiotherapist, Lisa Wilson and her training staff of seven for their pre and post game work and more importantly their excellent field management of injuries.  Trainers Allie Titus, Sarah Currie and Andrea Walsh worked this game.

 

The Black and Gold have potentially 3 games remaining.  If they win two, they will be in the AFL Championship and there is still the possibility of hosting the final.  I am positive that head coach Kelly and his assistants are working very hard on a three-peat but one game at a time.  Remember, “on any given Sunday (Saturday)”.  GO TIGERS!!!
