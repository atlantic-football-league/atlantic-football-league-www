The Dalhousie Tiger Football Club is within one win of their second perfect championship season in three years.  This Saturday, November 3rd at 2:30, Dal will host the Holland College Hurricanes at Wickwire Field in Halifax.  Coach Haggett’s black and gold, on a cool Saturday with no rain, gave everyone a chance to play football.  The AFL semi-final was almost over in the first Q, as the Tigers took a commanding 34-0 lead.  

Zacchary Kuhn opened the scoring on a one yard run and seconds later DB William Kenneford sprinted 45 yards down the sideline for a fumble recovery TD.  Malcolm Gascoigne made the first convert and missed the second.  Chad Kirkus’ short major run, set up by a longer spinning run, made the score 19-0, after a two point convert was missed.  Chris Duplisea ended the Q with aerial majors to all-star Alistair Chauhan (39 yards) and Kirkus (38 yards).  Gascoigne converted a six and Turner Kinal one and later two more on the day.  

Early in the second, Dal’s daunting D continued to force turnovers.  DB Joseph Fiander had an early fumble recovery to go along with an INT and a near pic.  Gordon Brown and Blake Rowe also pocketed errant passes, while Zack Leger (8), Connor Mason (6) and Wyatt Noel (6) laid the lumber. Jason Watt’s three yard plunge made the halftime score 41-0.  

The Seawolves were not without highlights.  The catch of the game came as Seb Brown layed out on a forty yard reception from Carter Posovad.  Riley Ring-Dineen’s 48 TD run was a work of art which  Rob
Burgess converted.  Moments later, Rob Wilson blocked a punt, recovered it and took it to the Tiger fourteen yard line.  The black and gold D held and the O took over on the six.

 In the last Q, Gascogne made a 35 yard three, but missed a 27 yarder.  Morgan capped the Tiger’s scoring on a six yard toss to Chauhan.  Kinal converted and the Seawolves were given a safety, leaving the game end score at 51-9.

This is the AFL’s tenth anniversary season and in a large part we can thank Barry Ogden of Saint John for its’ inception.  The league started with UNB Saint John, UNB Fredericton and Moncton.  Holland College and Dalhousie University, with a few strong volunteers and led by talented chairs, Mike O’Grady (HC) and Jim Wilson (Dal), took the step to join the Atlantic Football League.  Moncton dropped out during the second year.  

The league, under past commissioners and especially under present boss, Larry Wisniewski, has grown in strength, stature and visibility.  Thus,  approximately 200 post-secondary students play an exciting brand of football, and are developing physically, emotionally, mentally and socially as part of a great team sport.

Meatloaf’s “Two Out of Three Ain’t Bad”, could come to fruition for the Dal Tigers with one victory this weekend.  Two undefeated seasons in three would be GREAT!  But I am sure that the Holland College Hurricanes might have something to say in that regard!  GO TIGERS!!!
