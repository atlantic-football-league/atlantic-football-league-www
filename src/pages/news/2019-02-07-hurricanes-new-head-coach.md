title: "Hurricanes Football Club Announces Appointment Of New Head Coach"
---

**Thursday, February 7, 2019. Charlottetown –** The Holland College Hurricanes Football Club has announced the appointment of Stephen Letner as the team’s new head coach and Owen MacWilliams as assistant head coach, Hurricanes president Mike O’Grady announced today. Letner takes over from Ross Young, who stepped down at the end of last season.

O’Grady acknowledged the contribution of Coach Young, who served as head coach for the past three seasons: “We want to thank Ross for his time and energy — he took on the big challenge of head coach when the program needed him,” he said.

Steve Letner has been an assistant coach with the Hurricanes for the last five years, and has almost 15 years of coaching experience. A native of Ohio, Steve grew up in the heartland of American football and he has brought with him to PEI an unmatched passion for the game. Dedicated to growing the sport here, Letner led the Provincial Under 16 Football Team to a stunning upset victory in the Atlantic Bowl last year, defeating the previously unbeaten Nova Scotia squad.

In addition to being assistant head coach, Owen MacWilliams will work with the offensive line and share coordinating duties. MacWilliams played with the Hurricanes for four years and with St. F.X. and Acadia Axemen in the AUS, and Laurier University in the OUA.

Letner is in his first year of Holland College’s Sport and Leisure Management program after being in the workforce for several years. He said the goal of the coaching staff isn’t just to win back the Moosehead Cup.

“We want to prepare our players for life beyond Holland College, whether to pursue their educational and life goals, or to continue to play football at a higher level,” he said.

O’Grady was appreciative and complimentary when he announced the new head coach and assistant head coach.

“As the Hurricanes enter their tenth anniversary in the Atlantic Football League, it is reassuring to see coaches like Steve Letner and Owen MacWilliams giving back to the game. The Holland College football program is in good hands,” he said.
