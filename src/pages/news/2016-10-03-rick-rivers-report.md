Saturday September 24th will go down in Dalhousie Football history as 40 former Dal Tigers met to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the arrival of Canadian Football to the Dalhousie campus.  They came from as far away as Northern Ontario and after a heartwarming reception, they watched their former nemesis, UNB Red Bombers, vanquished 39 - 0.  This game also marked the first of a two game total point series for the Alumni Cup.  The second game will be played in Fredericton next Saturday.

Not quite as sharp as the week before, the Black and Gold were very impressed!  Veteran QB, Nick Hunsley went 22 for 39 for 275 yards with 3 td passes and 2 picks. Slot Back Louis Gauvin had an 85 td catch and run along with another td grab.  In total he had 5 catches for 162 yards. D'Arcy Chant had the other td aerial.  The power running of Zach Leger netted 71 yards on 12 carries for Dal's remaining major.

The defence again pitched a shutout with Jack Chaisson dominating with 9 tackles, 2 ints, one for a 25 yard pick 6.  Not to be out done, Matt McKenney had 10 tackles, a fumble recovery and a blocked punt.

It was a ideal evening for football as about 1,000 energetic fans cheered their team on. Thanks goes to many.  Sheila and Kirk from the alumni office, Linda and Barrie for the reception, the 36th CBG Band, enthusiastic cheerleaders, lively announcing by Rick and Jim and the presence of a vibrant university president who would have made that first 1947 team proud.
