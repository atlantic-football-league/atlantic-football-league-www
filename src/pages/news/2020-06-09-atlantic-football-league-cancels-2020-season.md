The Atlantic Football League has decided to cancel the AFL football season for the Fall of 2020.



The Board of Directors made this decision as they recognized the many years of competitive success the four team in the league have enjoyed. There is much to be grateful for in those years and much thanks to be extended to the many players, coaches and volunteers who have worked to that success.



However, we find ourselves as a society dealing with a serious health issue which directly effects the safety and well being of all of us. There are new rules and guidelines in place to insure we as a society do what we can to control the circumstances in which we find ourselves.



As a consequence of these circumstances, the Board of the AFL decided that the best interests of the League and of each of our individual teams could be found only in a tough and unhappy decision. That decision will be not to play a game we love in the Fall of 2020.



We will continue to monitor the changes in sport possibilities through the summer. We will continue to encourage everyone to find positive alternatives for everyone to help cross over the absence of the game to our return to it. Our focus as a league and as individual teams will be on making our return to football happen as quickly as possible and with adjustments or changes which will make our league stronger than it has ever been.
