***Charlottetown –*** The Holland College Hurricane’s men’s football team is looking to avenge their season opening loss to the UNB-Fredericton Red Bombers this Saturday at 1 p.m. at College Field in Fredericton.

In the first game of the year, the ‘Canes offense took some very costly penalties that cost them a touchdown and tremendous field position on four potential scoring drives.

Head coach Ross Young says that at this point in the season, the AFL teams are no longer strangers to each other.

“We’ve played every team once, the teams are much better prepared and the games naturally will tighten up as the season progresses,” he said.

“We’ve had a good week of practice. The players are very focused and understand the game plan for Fredericton. They are feeling confident and are looking forward to the challenge this Saturday.”

The Red Bomber’s have a nice running game and are a threat in the air with their receiving corps, so the ‘Canes’ coverage has to be better, and the team has to find a way to stop the running game. For the Hurricanes to have success this weekend, the offense has to be on the field more.

“They’re strong at home and well-coached. They’re disciplined on the offense line and their play calling is strong. We are anticipating a very tough opponent, but some very exciting football” Young said.

The ‘Canes will play their second home game on Saturday, October 14 at UPEI Alumni Canada Games Place. Kickoff will be at 1 p.m.
