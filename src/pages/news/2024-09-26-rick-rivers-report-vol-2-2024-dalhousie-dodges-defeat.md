It was another beautiful day for AFL football on the grass of UPEI campus as the Dalhousie Tigers dodged a bullet by scoring a last-minute TD to defeat the Holland College Hurricanes, 24-21.

The first Q saw both QBs intercepted on their first possessions.The Hurricanes would score first as Hunter Trus hit Keiler Purcell for the first 6 of the game and Simon

Hales’ PAT saw Holland up 7-0 at the 6:17 mark of the quarter.

After marching 105 yards early in the 2nd Q with a diverse offence, Ethan Lord scored and Liam Masner converted to tie the game at 7.QB Justin Vogels showed his AUS Mount Allison experience with excellent stats, 23/28 for 303 yards with 2TDs and 2 INTs.Not to be out done, Caden Quong carried numerous Hurricanes on his back as he bruised his way to 155 yards on 22 attempts.His longest run was 33 yards and the “O” line can take some credit for his 7 yards per carry

On the receiving end, Lord had 10 catches for 88 yards and David “Davoo” Shamsuddin-Ciato pulled in 7 for 68 yards, most on patented WR screens.OC, Matt Zwicker must be ecstatic on the Tigers over 500 yards of offence.Masner’s mid-range FG put the black and gold up 17-7 at the half.

Trus long pass to Erron Beachey brought the Canes to within 3 in the 3rd Q.Defensive co-ordinator, Freddie Diab wouldn’t be totally happy with his D only allowing two TDs in this physical contest.Kyle Mark and Sam Martin led the way with 3 tackles each and an interception, while Logan Steeves, Matt Irvine, Liam Chisari and David Arevalo all had 3 hits.

Two of the three units had performed well but the special teams allowed Holland back in the game.Poor centering on punts and long returns nearly accounted for a Tiger loss.One of the most exciting plays in Canadian football can be a missed FG and it turned out to be a truism for HC.Keegan Cadona’s scintillating 110 yard return off a Dal missed FG put the Hurricanes ahead, 21-17.

If you are a football fan and especially a black and gold supporter, the fourth Q was worth the price of admission and the heart palpitations.The first two possessions by both teams resulted in 3 and out.The Tigers later had a few drives deep inside the Canes red zone.One resulted in a negated TD on a holding call and another on a vaunted goal line stand by Holland College.

A very steady punt returner, Luke Procter, became a hero with a 35 plus return to give the Tigers a last chance for the thrill of victory with 2:05 remaining.Dante Gabrielli playing RB gave the black and gold 2 first down runs on the ensuing drive.On the game he bulled his way his way for 67 yards on 8 carries.These helped to set up the game winning TD toss from Vogels to Lord.Masner made the PAT and the Tiger DBs stopped Holland’s last minute aerial attempts.Could this be another “Year of the Tiger”.Final Dal 24, HC 21.

In order for the Dal Tigers to win another game and especially another AFL title, they must become more disciplined.This was reflected in the 20 penalties they committed in the HC game.Most glaring were the 5 for objectionable conduct. Holland had 10 penalties and three were for OCs.Penalties will stop drives, negate TDs, and allow your opponent to take advantage of your miscues. These were seen on all three sides of the ball.I am sure that Head Coach Gougen will be all over this during the week.

The Tigers will next play the defending champion, UNB Reds in Dalhousie’s Homecoming on Saturday at 12:30 on Wickwire Field.It will be the 15th anniversary of the NEW ERA TIGERS and the 70th anniversary of the 1954 PURDY CUP CHAMPIONS.

Dalhousie Tiger fans come and enjoy the amazing event which is an afternoon at Wickwire Field.GO TIGERS!
