In a total team effort, rookie Dalhousie Head Coach, Mark Haggett’s Tigers dominated the Saint John Seawolves, 39-0.

Second year running back Zack Leger lead the Dal “O” with 192 yards rushing and one TD on 23 carries and threw an 18 yard TD pass to Spenser Muise. Offensive Coordinator, Evan Brown's offence was quarterbacked by veteran Nick Hunsley who threw for 173 yards on 13 of 19 for 2 TDs and one pick. Guillaume Bernier led Dal’s receivers with 5 catches for 97 yards and a major (18yards). Louis Gauvin had 5 catches for 56 yards and ran 3 times for 27 yards. Alistair Chauhan had the remaining 6 points on a 13 yard aerial. Not to be missed; 3 field goals, 3 converts and a single off the foot of Rob Wilson.

Steve Majury’s defence only allowed the Seawolves over center field once in the game. The Black & Gold “D” was led by linebacker Jack Chaisson (5 tackels, 1 sack), lineman Jesse Legault (2 tackles and 2 sacks) and DB, Kenzie MacNeil (3 tackles and 1 pick).

The Tigers will be at home Saturday, September 24 at 6:00pm on Wickwire Field to the UNB Red Bombers in the first of a 2 game series for the Alumni Cup. The game will also mark the 70th year of the arrival of Canadian Football at Dalhousie. Former players, coaches, cheerleaders and fans are welcome to this celebration.
