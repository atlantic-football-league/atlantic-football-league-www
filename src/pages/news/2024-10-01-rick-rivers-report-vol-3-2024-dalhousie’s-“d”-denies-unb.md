It was another perfect weather day for AFL football. Sunny and warm for the most part with a few short periods of sprinkles that did not spoil the Tigers, 19-7 victory over the defending champs, the UNB Reds.It was Homecoming and Wickwire Field sparkled with 1,500 + students in black and gold pounding their thunder sticks.

The Homecoming game sponsored by McInnes Cooper paid tribute to the 1954 Purdy Cup winning Tigers on their 70th anniversary. Stars Reg Cluney and Stu McInnes would becomemembers of that vaunted law firm.They along with the likes of Dave Bryson and Scorchy MacVicar had won the Cup in 1951 and would be happy with today’s victory.

This year also marks the 15th anniversary of the founding of the new-era Tigers lead by Jim Wilson, Rick Rivers and support of many others.The Dal squad is hoping to win their 5th AFL championship this season.On a sad note, a moment of silence was taken to remember Scott Martin, a recent O-line coach and equipment manager who passed away in July.

Now, to the game played.Dalhousie’s “D” dominated the tilt denying the Reds any major marches and forcing them into poor field position.This resulted in UNB giving up 3 safety touches.The black and gold’s first points came off a safety at the 6:34 mark of the first Q.

RB, Caden Quong was again the work horse for the Tigers, accounting probably 100 plus yards and many firstdowns.QB, Justin Vogels was not as sharp passing as last week, but did gain valuable yards on scrambles and designed QB runs.He did connect with Ethan Lord on a 13 yard toss for the black and gold’s first TD.Liam Masner made the PAT and the Reds gave up another safety to make the score 11-0 at the half.

Half time was fan fun and excitement.Highlights included student 3-legged races, a donair eating contest and a monster hamster ball football competition along with multiple lucrative draws.But the fan fav had to be the Tug-O-War where the girl’s rugby team embarrassed the boys in dragging them over the line in two consecutive pulls.

The dynamic duo of punt returners, Dante Gabrielli and Luke Procter made the game highlight reel with numerous returns.They should be the special team players of the day for their multiple fancy foot work and speed returns, giving the Tigers constant great field position.The Dal OL was again steady allowing for a number of long pass completions.Two were to Kaden Butt, one for a TD which was negated by a penalty.The second for 45 yardswhich set up Brennen Hynes’ 5 yard run major.A 2 point convert attempt was unsuccessful, but another Reds safety gave the Tigers a 19-0 lead.

Logan Steeves led the D line with multiple sacks and tackles.Linebackers, Sam Martin, Max Parker and Liam Chisari stopped first downs and hurried QB Jonah Rawlines in the pocket.Rawlines attempted many long passes but the TD of the game came on his 85 yard major to speedy Jace Taylor.Until that point Dal DB’s had played near perfect pass “D”.A couple of pass interference calls were debatable and gave UNB first downs.

Justin Remillard’s PAT was good making the score Tigers 19, Reds 7 with 7:30 remaining in the game.Not surprising, the Reds attempted an onside kick which saw the ball bounce off a cluster of players and thankfully Aron Brooks made the catch to give Dalhousie possession and stop UNB’s momentum.Nothing of consequence happened after, as the Dal “D” continued to deny UNB.

The Tigers’ football Homecoming event was a success and the black and gold are undefeated.Next Saturday they face a formidable task in defeating the Reds at home.Hope a lot of Tiger fans will drive toFrederictonand enjoy the fall foliage along the way. Is this another “Year of the Tiger”?

GO TIGERS!!!
