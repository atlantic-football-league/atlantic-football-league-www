The Holland College Hurricanes Football Club look to get back to their winning ways when they make their 2016 home debut against the University of New Brunswick Saint John Seawolves this Saturday at 1 p.m. at the UPEI Alumni Canada Games Place.

Holland College defeated UNBSJ on their own turf in the Seawolves’ home opener, scoring five unanswered points in the second half to come out on top 7-3. Now, the Seawolves aim to return the favour.

The Saint John squad returns to Charlottetown for the first time since the two teams met in a Week 2 matchup last September when the Hurricanes defeated them 21-9. The Seawolves (0-2) will try to turn their season around against the Hurricanes (1-1), who lost in an overtime thriller against the UNB Red Bombers last weekend in Fredericton.

The offence started to come around in the second quarter against the Bombers, when a four-play, 47-yard drive was capped off by running back Andre Goulbourne, who punched it in the end zone for the team’s first offensive touchdown of the year.

The Hurricanes, who forced three turnovers in that game, will look to their defence and special teams unit once again to maintain their strong play, while the offence continues to find its rhythm.

“This promises to be an exciting game,” said Hurricanes head coach Ross Young, “we are looking forward to playing in front of our home town crowd for the first time this season.”
