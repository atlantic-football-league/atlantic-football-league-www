Charlottetown, PE - The Holland College Hurricanes men’s football team will look to secure home-field advantage through the AFL playoffs when they square off against the Dalhousie Tigers this Saturday at 1 p.m.

The ‘Canes returned home after winning three straight road games. Last week’s forfeiture by the UNB-Saint John Seawolves took the Hurricanes record to 4-1,  putting them in second place. Although the team was awarded two points, head coach Ross Young said nobody in the organization, including the coaches and players wanted to win that way.

“We wanted to play every game for those points.”

With the loss of a scheduled game, the team was concerned about losing momentum going with their week of practice preparing to face the Dalhousie Tigers this weekend. The Hurricanes have been working all week to be ready to take on the Tigers this weekend, Young said.

“We’re up against a worthy opponent in Dalhousie who can score and defend what they need to,” he said.

The ‘Canes had a good scrimmage this past Saturday in lieu of the game, and have made some personnel changes and play adjustments.

After the dust settles this weekend, the ‘Canes will find out where they are in the standings, and hope to assure a home game next weekend for the playoffs. With four teams in the league, anyone can win on any given day. All the teams get to know each other well as the season goes along, so games become tighter with momentum swings making for exciting football.

“We expect a hard-fought, close football game,” said Young.

The Hurricanes and the Tigers hit the field at 1 p.m. at UPEI Alumni Canada Games Place, as usual, the game will feature the now legendary tail gate food prepared by The Culinary Institute of Canada, the Holland College Welshmen Band, and a 50/50 draw.

The game will be webcast by Bell Aliant.
