> It was a win but not a pretty one. The Holland College Hurricanes came to play, and the final score wasn't indicative of the game. Hurricane Fiona washed out the Tiger's visit to the island, so late last week it was decided that this game would count double in the standings. A good size home crowd with a lot of boisterous Hurricane supporters watched a defensive struggle. The intensity was great as witnessed by the tackles of Holland's Joseph Bertran and Tyler Newson, and Dal's Liam Chisari, Christian Riley and Mike MacKensie. Key interceptions by Tiger's Connor McCormick, Logan Hillier, and Jeremy Miller ended Hurricane drives. The Tiger D has been consistent while the O having had big shows in the first 2 games was out of sync.

> Tiger QB Noah Glover had an off day passing, throwing short on numerous occasions and having 2 passes intercepted, one on the Holland 4-yard line. Holland's D deserved much of the credit with their pressure but Glover redeemed himself with multiple runs for first downs. It was good to see Javier Reyes Landry back with Mitchell Page, who scored Dal's first major. Okyay Kepenek converted. Holland gave up a safety touch and Hurricane punter Kyle Cameron kicked a single from a rollout to make the score 9-1 Tigers at halftime.

> Kepenek opened the 2nd half with a 31 yard field goal but later missed a 27-yarder. During the 3rd quarter, Chisari, always good on punt returns, made a huge return to get the BG out of their end. Another highlight saw Anders Hoffman make a phenomenal catch to keep a drive alive. Hurricane's Daniel Nkorkomalimba was the most electric on the field and threatened to score numerous times. Give kudos to Patrick Mpuanga, DC coordinator, whose D bent a little but never broke. The third quarter ended with the Tigers up 12 - 1.

> But a tight hard fought game turned into a bit of a route late in the fourth quarter as Riley caused a strip-sack fumble which MacKensie romped over 65 yards for a Tiger touchdown. Minutes later, with a little over a minute left in the game, a Tiger FG attempt went awry. Kepenek would show his running ability, sprinting 22 yards for 6 points. His 2nd convert in 3 minutes was good, making the final score Dal 26, Holland College 1.

> The Tigers could lock up first place with a win in Fredericton this Saturday. It is also the second game of the Tigers vs. Red Bombers Challenge Cup. The Black and Gold defeated UNBF 29 to 25 in an exciting season opener. If Dal were to lose by 5 or more points this weekend the Reds could possibly finish in 1st place. So, Tiger fans come out and enjoy the fall foliage as you drive to Fredericton to cheer on the Tigers!
