Basketball players, Lexi MacInnis and Jace Colley were named the 2019 Holland Hurricanes Athletes of the Year on Friday evening at the Culinary Institute of Canada.

MacInnis, of Stratford, PEI, had a strong season in 2018-2019 despite playing for a rebuilding team that struggled in the standings.  She ultimately was named to the first All-Conference team in the Atlantic Collegiate Athletic Association (ACAA) and was also recognized as a Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) Academic All-Canadian.  Earlier in the evening, she was named the Hurricanes women’s basketball Most Valuable Player.

In 21 regular season games, MacInnis averaged 14 points, 6.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game.  She was the Hurricanes leading scorer while also leading the conference in three-pointers.

Colley, of East Preston, Nova Scotia, had a tremendous season, leading the Hurricanes to their seventh straight ACAA Championship.  In the process, Colley was named the CCAA National men’s basketball Player of the Year, as well as a CCAA All-Canadian.  At the conference level he was named the ACAA Player of the Year and a member of the first ACAA All-Conference team.  Colley was also named the Hurricanes men’s basketball Most Valuable Player on Friday.

Colley led the Hurricanes with 23.5 points per game this season while averaging 8.0 rebounds.  His field-goal shooting percentage was 61.3 while recording 22 blocks, 77 assists and 27 steals during the regular season.

MacInnis and Colley were named the Holland Hurricanes men’s and women’s Rookies of the Year award a year ago; this is the first time that the Rookie of the Year award winners the year prior went on to be named the Athletes of the Year the following year.

Earlier in the evening on Friday, Lori-Beth Dwyer (women’s volleyball) was named the Holland Hurricanes Coach of the Year.  The award comes just weeks after Dwyer announced that she would be stepping away from the head coaching role for with the ‘Canes.  This is the first time she’s received the award.

Rookies of the Year recipients were Abby Hyndman (volleyball) and Shunya Kobayashi (soccer).

Hyndman, from Charlottetown, PEI, was impressive in her first season at the collegiate level.  During a season that saw the ‘Canes take home a conference silver medal, she was named the ACAA Rookie of the Year as well as a member of the second ACAA All-Conference team.  She was also recognized as a CCAA Academic All-Canadian.

Kobayashi, from Yachiyo, Japan, took the ACAA by storm in 2018, leading the Hurricanes to an ACAA Championship before hosting the CCAA National Championship on Prince Edward Island.   During the season, Kobayashi was named a CCAA All-Canadian, CCAA Academic All-Canadian, the ACAA Player of the Year and a member of the ACAA first All-Conference team.

During the evening, the Hurricanes announced that the ten CCAA All-Canadians from the 2018-19 season were once again the most of any CCAA member across the country.

This year, 172 student-athletes from 45 colleges across Canada achieved combined excellence in athletics and academics.

The CCAA Academic All-Canadian award is the CCAA’s most prestigious student-athlete honour, epitomizing a commitment to academic success and athletic achievement.

In addition, the CCAA Academic All-Canadian Recognition Award is presented each year to the institution with the most student-athlete award recipients, for the fifth-straight year, the award was won by the Hurricanes.

“Our athletics program is thrilled with earning this national standings for the fifth consecutive year,” shared Director of Athletics and Recreation for the Hurricanes, Albert Roche.

“Leading the country in academics and athletics is a highly sought after award and as a small institution we believe this is a hallmark of success.”
