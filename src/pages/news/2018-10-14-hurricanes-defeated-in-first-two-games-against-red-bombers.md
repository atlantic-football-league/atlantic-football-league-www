**Sunday, October 14, 2018. Charlottetown, PEI –** The Holland Hurricanes fell to the UNB Fredericton Red Bombers 30-16 in one of the final games of the regular season on Saturday.

Defence started slowly for the Hurricanes as a result of the injuries that have haunted their starting lineup up.Early in the first quarter, UNB scored an off-tackle run play for a major from their 20-yard line that should have been handled by the Hurricanes defence.

Later in the same quarter, the Hurricanes defence bent, but didn't break, and the Bombers settled for a field goal. Near the end of the half the Hurricanes kicker Connor Cruichshank nailed a field goal for the ’Canes.

The Hurricanes offence started making plays, and before the end of the first half Cruichshank scored a field goal, making it 10 to 3 at the end of the first half.

The Bombers took advantage of bad field position for the ’Canes in the 3rd quarter bringing the score to 17 to 3. The Hurricanes made adjustments and rallied, with Brady Crowe scoring a rushing touchdown from the Bombers’ 1-yard line, pushing the points to 17 to 9.  ’Canes holder Michale Petroschke missed a 2-point conversion.

Just when the ’Canes were playing well in both sides of the ball, the Bombers returned a ’Canes punt for a major, making the score 23 to 9. Bombers were wide on their extra point attempt.

Late in the fourth, Hurricanes quarterback Brady Crowe hit receiver Kaye-Mitchell for a nice 25-yard reception for a Hurricanes TD. Cruichshank added the extra point, bringing the score to 23-16 for the Bombers.

With less than 2 minutes to play, the ’Canes were trying to mount a comeback to tie the game but failed to score on three passing attempts.With bad field position, the Hurricanes could not hold off the Bombers’ last attack, with the hometown Bombers scoring a major with 30 seconds left.

Hurricanes linebacker Jesse Getson had a strong day, as did DB Tristen Hull.On the offence, receiver Kaye-Mitchell put in another strong  performance with fellow receiver Adam Shambe pulling in a 25- yard pass followed, but a 40-yard run to the end zone was tackled just short of the line.

“The ’Canes defence and special teams need to make some adjustments this week to prepare to make up for the defeat,” said Hurricanes head coach Ross Young. “Our offence showed signs of a strong run and pass game and we are looking forward to a rematch this weekend. We will need to make some personnel adjustments and work on our execution. If we prepare well and fix our mistakes, we will beat the Bombers.”

The Hurricanes meet the Bombers again on Sunday, October 21 at 1 p.m. on MacAdam Field at UPEI Canada Games Place.
