Football rivalries are often exaggerated but the Dalhousie Tigers and the University of New Brunswick Reds are not one of them.

These two teams met in the early 1950’s playing in the HCCL and continued through the Bluenose Football League until Dalhousie dropped varsity football in 1976 and a few years later UNB would stop playing this great team sport.An over 30 year void followed.

In 2009, the Atlantic Football League was born and the following year the Dal Tigers joined the UNBF Reds, the Holland College Hurricanes and the UNBSJ Seawolves.Since the inception of the AFL, the Reds have won 5 titles and the Tigers 4.Ten years ago, UNB instituted the Alumni Cup, a two game annual series between the two largest Atlantic universities.Coming into today both schools have won the Cup four times, with no competition during 2021, a Covid year.

Last Saturday, during the McInnes Cooper-sponsored Homecoming weekend, Dalhousie stymied the Reds before a raucous crowd, 19-7 on Wickwire Field.This week’s contest was definitely more contentious as the game lead changed numerous times in a rousing fourth Q.The Tigers took the victory with less than two minutes remaining, 31-28.But more excitement was coming!

To say the least, it was filled with crazy moments in those final few minutes. Tiger QB, Justin Vogels, was the offensive hero of the game.He escaped the pocket two times (6 in the game) on the TD drive for first downs and then threw to Ethan Lord for the major.Dante Gabrielli ran for the two point convert.But their was still time on the clock.

The Reds took over and Matt Irvine made a great play on a Reds’ pass to stop a completion and next play Kyle Merk followed with an INT which should have been the end.Sideline celebrations began!The Tigers now tried to run out the clock but were unsuccessful and had to punt.This proved costly as the snap was fumbled and UNB recovered on the black and gold 42 yard line.The red and white went deep twice and the DB’s were up to the challenge.On third down Logan Steeves sacked Rawlines for a second time, terminating the Reds last chance to win.The Tiger “O” then took the victory formation and ran out the clock, winning their 5th Alumni Cup, 48 to 35 (2 game total score).

The game had begun on cloudy day with rain threatening and the Dal squad looked like they would easily win the Cup, taking a 20-0 lead late in the second Q.Dante Gabrielli scored first on a 5 yard run and Justin Vogels completed an aerial major to Callum Munn.Liam Masner kicked 2 PATs and 2 FGs (37 and 12 yards).

But the tough and resilient Reds in the final few minutes of the half saw Angus Gelaty fall on a blocked punt for 6 and Thomas Hoyt catch a Jonah Rawlines TD pass.Justin Remillard kicked both converts making the score a troubling 20-14 for Dalhousie.

UNB took a 21-20 lead in the 3rd Q as Rawlines found Nick Parker for a major.Remillard converted and minutes later Liam Masner’s 12 yard FG put the black and gold ahead, 23-21.What looked like a possibly game clenching TD on a 20 pass and run play from Vogels to David Shamsuddin-Ciata was ruled a fumble and a touch back on the Reds tackle giving them the ball, on their one yard line.

On their next possession the UNB team took advantage of two Dal pass interference calls and one unsportsmanlike penalty to have the ball on the Tigers’ one.Matt Lafleur scored from there and the PAT was good.UNB was now up 28-23.

The Dalhousie Tigers’ standout blocking again lead them to 250 plus yards on the ground and allowed Vogels to complete 10 of 20 for 153 yards and 2 TDs. Caden Quong led the RBs with 107 yards on 16 carries, while Brennen Hynes gained 64 on 12 and Vogels ran the ball 10 times for 82 and was sacked twice.Matt Lawton had 2 catches for 66 yards and Ethan Lord had 4 receptions for 40 yards to round out the offence.The staunch Tiger “D” allowed only minimal yardage and again was led by Logan Steeves 2 sacks and 6 tackles.Liam Chisari had 5Ts and Christian Riley, 3Ts and 1 sack.

The black and gold Tigers game is next week in Saint John against the Falcons.Dalhousie fans travel well and hopefully that good UNB nucleus and more will show up for the port city encounter.Wickwire Field should be rocking the following weekend for the regular season finale.Home field advantage could be on the line as the Tigers face the physical Hurricanes.

Could this be the “Year of the Tiger”?GO TIGERS!!

\*I would be remiss if I did not speak to the camaraderie/sportsmanship shown to the Reds’ Cory Schneider as he was stretchered off the field between the red and gold sides who formed a funnel of support that led to a waiting ambulance.Everyone’s thoughts and prayers go to Cole and also to Dal’s Luke Procter who was also taken to the hospital later in the game.

A huge THANK YOU to the Tiger and Reds’ medical staff!
