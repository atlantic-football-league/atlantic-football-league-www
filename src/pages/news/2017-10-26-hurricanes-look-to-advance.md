***Charlottetown –*** The Holland College men’s football team will be looking to advance to the AFL championship game when they square off against the Dalhousie Tigers in the semifinal this Saturday at 1 p.m. at UPEI Alumni Canada Games Place.

The ‘Canes enjoyed last week’s victory against the Tigers, but they had trouble gaining momentum in the first quarter. The forfeiture of the game the week before by the Saint John Seawolves made it tough for the offense to get their rhythm back. They took too many penalties that cost them yardage and two major scores.

The Hurricanes won, but the team will have to clean up its game if it wants to advance, head coach Ross Young said.

“This team is special. We have a lot of assets in our offense who can find a way to get it done. After adjustments, our defence performed well and we were very happy about that,” he said.

The Dalhousie Tigers are an explosive team with strong receivers and running backs. The fact the two teams, which are evenly matched, are seeing each other in back to back games makes preparation more challenging. Each team is wondering what new look the other is going to bring, but there are not a lot of adjustments the ‘Canes can make.

“It’s a battle of who can have the best week of practice,” said Young. “The winner of the semifinal game will be the team who can execute on Saturday.”

The ‘Canes remain upbeat heading into this weekend’s game. The players are focused and loose. The coaching staff want them to enjoy every moment. The team is having a great week of game prep.

“Now it’s up to the players to execute and get this done,” Young said. “It’s always a great day in Charlottetown when Dalhousie comes to play.”

All minor football players from P.E.I. are invited to the game, and encouraged to wear their team jersey.
The playoff game, which will likely be the last home game for the Hurricanes this year, will feature the fan favourite tailgate food prepared by The Culinary Institute of Canada, a 50/50 draw, college mascot Samuel and his mini ‘Canes, and a special appearance by the Thrill the Island flash mob, who will be performing at halftime and collecting monetary donations for the Upper Room food bank.
