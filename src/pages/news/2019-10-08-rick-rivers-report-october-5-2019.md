CONSISTENCY

Throughout the first three games of the season, coach Haggett had been working for team consistency. He found it in game four, a 48-0 victory over the UNBSJ Seawolves at Wickwire Field. The brisk wind dropped at sundown and the moon shone on a relatively mild evening as the Tigers three phases of ball ran on all cylinders.

The teams played through a scoreless struggle in the first quarter and then the flood gates opened for the black and gold. Dalhousie erupted for two quick touchdowns in four minutes. QB Chris Duplisea(21/27/403yards and 4 Tds) connected with lanky sure handed Jack Underhill (9/157- 2Tds) on a 26 yard aerial strike for the six. Minutes later speedy Cairo Berry (2/91-1Td) streaked the team sidelines on receiving a Duplisea pass for the 68 yard major.

On the next possession by Reds’ quarterback Jared Laming and their one dimensional passing offence, they were stopped on third and three by one of Dal’s defensive standouts, Jesse Legault as he blocked the pass to stop the Seawolves only substantive drive of the game. The Tigers took advantage quickly as the Dal QB hit the free wheeling Underhill on three consecutive passes ending with a major, his second.

Next the Seawolves went three and out and with little more than a minute remaining in the half, Duplisea led the black and gold on another quick march resulting in a short run by him for the six with thirteen seconds remaining in the quarter. All converts attempted were for two points, with Duplisea completing five of five. Probably a team record, the Tigers scored 32 points with a little over nine minutes left in the second quarter.

The Tigers started where they left off in the second Q as Jack Campbell (8/62) carried the ball for consecutive first downs setting up a 38 yard Chauhan (3/59-Td) Td reception from Duplisea. Matt Lindsay grabbed his second two point convert on the day putting the score at 40-0 at 12:38 of the third Q. The game clock would now run non-stop, an AFL mercy rule. The Seawolves conceded a safety early in the fourth period, making the score 42-0. UNBSJ mounted a short drive but electric Will Hunter had an 80 yard pick six to end the scoring at 48-0 as the convert was missed.

David Kelly, DC, is happy as he sees his “youngsters” getting better as they “further understand” and “buy into” the Tiger D. Kelly says the big test comes this week. The first place Red Bombers will play Dalhousie this Saturday and the Tigers will remember their worst defensive outing in week two, as they gave up 46 points in the 46-45 loss in Fredericton.

This week as usual Jesse Legault led the Ds with 6 Ts and D line partner, big Liam Gould had 3Ts and 2 sacks. Dynamic Liam Chisari responded with 5 hits and safety Aidan Leszkowiat came up with 2 monster hits in his 5 and one interception. This maturing D will be better prepared for the old school 7 tight power running of the Red Bombers on Saturday October 12 at 1 PM.

Wear your black and gold, be loud and proud as you cheer Dalhousie to first place and a home field advantage in the playoffs. Oh, the Alumni Cup is also up for grabs! The Reds have a one point lead in the two game total point series. GO TIGERS!!
