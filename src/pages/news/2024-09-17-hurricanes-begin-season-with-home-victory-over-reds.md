A second quarter field goal by Hales would cut the lead down to 7-5 before a field goal by UNB before half sent the teams to the locker rooms with the Reds ahead, 10-5.

The second half would see UNB miss a field-goal but secure a point with a rouge to make it 11-5.

The ‘Canes would enter the final quarter down by six, which was erased when Keegan Cardona scored a touchdown with 14:18 remaining.A blocked extra point had the game tied at 11-11.

Hales would put the ‘Canes ahead with a rouge off the kickoff on the next play, putting the ‘Canes up 12-11, before a touchdown late in the quarter by Aaron McCardle extended the lead to 19-11.A rouge to end the game gave the ‘Canes the 20-11 victory.
