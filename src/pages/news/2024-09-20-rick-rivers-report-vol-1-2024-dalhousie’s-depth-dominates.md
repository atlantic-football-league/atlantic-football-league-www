The Dal Tigers’ home opening program shows, Gabrielli, Melanson and Quong beaching it.Over a thousand black and gold fans enjoyed Wickwire Field’s beach like sun and temps.It was a perfect day for football as the Tigers opened the season with a lopsided, 69-0 victory over the Saint John Falcons.It was great to see a new Saint John team in the Atlantic Football League and there is no doubt they will get better each time out.

Dalhousie dressed 55 players and I would venture to say everyone saw game action.I have been involved with the new era Tigers since their inception and I have never seen the quality positional depth they showed today.

All three QBs performed well, as did five running backs and multiple receivers.The “O” line kept the QBs upright and openedgreat holes for the RBs.The Tiger “D” was tenacious and it limited the Falcons running game to more losses than gains.Falcon QB, Logan Saulnier, played tough but was sacked numerous times, yet managed to complete a few passes while on the run.

One of his passes produced a highlight of the day.Receiver Cody Carr leapt to make a one handed acrobatic catch and managed to keep his feet in bounds on the landing.The catch resulted in one of a few first downs for the Saint John squad.

The game scoring started just three minutes into the first Q as probably the games leading rusher, Caden Quong, set up Justin Vogels’ QB sneak TD with a 30 yard run on the play before.Minutes later Daniel Forbes had a pick 6.Liam Masner converted both majors but missed a short FG, on Dalhousie’s next possession.Otherwise he was perfect on his kicks throughout the game.With just over a minute left in the Q, Vogels combined with Ethan Lord, making the score, 21-0.

QB, Dante Gabrielli, took over in the second Q, showing last year’s admirable form.He ran for two TDs and a two point conversion.Gabrielli also completed a short pass to David Shamsuddin-Ciata for a major.Brennen Hynes, another work horse, ran for a TD.The Falcons gave up a safety, making the score at the half, 52-0 Dal.

As a result of a league rule, a lead of over 35 points at half time, would see the game clock run non stop, with a few exceptions in the second half of the game.Gabrielli threw to Lord for his second 6 and Masner hit a short FG making the score 62-0 with ten minutes to play in the game.

Rookie valley QB, Jonas Anderson, looked good in his AFL debut in completing multiple passes with a few to Steve Sorenson.But the Tigers’ game highlight had to be the 40 yard TD run by Alessandro Ibarra-Rodriguez as he ran through a few Falcons and sprinted to pay dirt.

Tiger Head Coach, Andre Goguen had to be happy with his team’s overall performance.But he knows Holland College, next week’s opponent, will be much tougher.The Holland College Hurricanes opened their season with a 20-11 victory over the defending champion UNB Reds.

Black and Gold fans join us in PEI and get in a last round of golf or a beach day on Saturday before the one o’clock kickoff on Sunday on the UPEI campus.GO TIGERS!
