The Countdown is on for Red Bombers Reunion 2016 Sept. 30 & Oct 1. It looks like we have a lot of returning players, coaches and staff from every era for this one. Don’t miss it!

An RSVP is NOT necessary. But if you do know you’re coming, hit “reply” and let us know. We have left Jim off this particular newsletter list. Details below.

Be with us at **UNB Homecoming 2016, Sept. 30 – Oct 1.** The 2016 **Red Bombers Reunion** Celebrating **“The Jim Born Years 1971-1980”.**

We’re looking forward to the return to campus of all the teammates, coaches, managers and trainers who played for Jim and were part of **THE BORN IDENTITY**.

Mike Dollimore has reached out to many of you and your Captains to join us.

- **Friday, Sept 30 starting at 5:00pm** we’ll have an informal gathering in the EndZone refreshment tent on the BMO Centre field (below the Aitken Centre) during the Red Bombers evening practice, to catch-up with one another. All Red Bomber alumni as well as family, friends, and fans of the Red Bombers are welcome. Happy Hour on the football field…
- Then please reserve **Saturday morning** for light refreshments in the **Blue Room at the Student Union Building (SUB) at 11:00am**. From there we’ll march to the field and be recognized as a group at mid-field, present mementoes to Jim commemorating the day, with the opening **Kick-off at 1:15** against the Dalhousie University Tigers.
- **After the game** you are all invited to the Colter Room in the Aitken Centre to mingle with the current Coaches and Players.

Call an old friend and make plans to be at this year’s UNB Red Bombers Reunion.
