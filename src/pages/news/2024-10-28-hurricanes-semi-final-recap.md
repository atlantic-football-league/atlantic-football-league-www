The football Hurricanes had their 2024 season conclude with a tough 38-20 loss to the UNB Reds at the BMO Centre in Fredericton, N.B. on Saturday.

UNB had a fiery start offensively, going up 7-0 just minutes into the match with a rushing touchdown and successful PAT. Things remained stable until the closing minutes as a throwing touchdown and good PAT gave the Reds a 14-0 lead going into the second quarter. The lead was extended to 21-0 just past halfway through quarter two thanks to another throwing touchdown and successful PAT. With 2:48 remaining, Holland finally found offensive momentum, as fourth-year quarterback Hunter Prus (Bedeque, P.E.I.) connected with second-year receiver Wolf Sym (Tillsonburg, Ontario) for a throwing touchdown and a good PAT. The momentum was later scorched by a rushing touchdown and PAT for the Reds, making it 28-7 at halftime.

An early touchdown by UNB in the third quarter made the score 35-7. The Hurricanes struck back with a touchdown and PAT by Aaron McCardle (Kinburn, Ontario). Early in the fourth quarter, a field goal by UNB gave them a 38-14 lead, but minutes later, Prus scored another touchdown to make the score 38-20. Unfortunately, Holland couldn’t mount any more momentum within the final 10 minutes, sealing the deal for the Reds to advance to the AFL Championship Game.

The Reds will face the Dalhousie Tigers next Saturday in the Championship Game in Halifax.
