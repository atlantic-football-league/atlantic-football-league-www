The Holland College Hurricanes will face their toughest test to date Saturday when they take on the Dalhousie Tigers in Halifax.

The last time the two squads met, the Hurricanes captured their third consecutive championship in a 32-24 thriller.

But with a new season comes a new opportunity, and the Tigers are aiming to dethrone the perennial champions.

“It’s going to be a huge test for us,” said Hurricanes head coach Ross Young. “They’re confident about their game right now and I think they’re eager to redeem themselves.”

The undefeated Tigers are a powerful dual-threat team that causes matchup problems for any opponent. Offensively, they’re a force to be reckoned with, averaging a league-high 34.3 points per game – a far cry from the next closest team, the second place Hurricanes, who average 14.7 points per contest.

Not only do the Tigers put plenty of points on the board, they also stop the opposition from scoring. In three games, their defence hasn’t allowed a single point, making them one of the strongest units in league history.

“They’re executing well offensively and they’re strong defensively, so it’s going to be a good challenge for us,” said Young.

Despite the overwhelming odds, the Hurricanes are looking forward to the challenge and hope to disrupt Dalhousie’s early-season dominance.

“Our team is getting stronger each week,” Young said. “When we hit the field on Saturday, I just want to make sure we’re prepared for whatever Dalhousie throws our way.”

With a steady defence and an offence that is getting stronger each week, Young is expecting it to be a very exciting game with first place on the line.

“Every unit has to put points on the board if we’re going to have success this weekend.”

The game will be held at Wickwire Field in Halifax on October 8 at 6 p.m.
