Two weeks ago I talked of the TIGERS-REDS’ rivalry.This week I can add the HURRICANES to the mix.On a beautiful late Sunday afternoon, the Tigers rode an exciting roller coaster of highs and lows as Dalhousie eked out a 31-28 overtime victory against Holland College to end a perfect 6-0 regular season.In their first meeting the Tigers had a come from behind win, edging HC, 24 to 21, in the waning minutes on the Island.

If the Hurricanes had beaten the Tigers, they would have finished second and had home-field advantage for the semi-final against the UNB Reds.Holland had something to prove after being trounced in Fredericton by the Reds.In their first game the Hurricanes had won at home.

In the other season-ending game, the Saint John Falcons, who had forfeited to Dalhousie the weekend before, showed improvement.The Falcons scored a season-high 20 points in their loss to UNB.Sad to say, but the Saint John squad have chosen to forfeit the other semi, one versus four, to the Tigers.Therefore, Dal will have a bye this weekend and will wait for either the Hurricanes or the Reds in the AFL Final on November 2 at Wickwire Field.

Falcon player injuries have seen player numbers drop below the minimal league standard.The Falcons have agreed to pay Dalhousie and the AFL the financial penalties.The Saint John squad has promised to return next season, better prepared for the competitive AFL.

Now, back to Sunday’s titanic struggle at Wickwire, where both defences played well in the first half.HC’s LB, Tyler Newson, was the defensive standout with numerous tackles in the Tiger backfield and a monster sack, before leaving the game injured, late in the second Q. Dal’s “O” could not take advantage of a blocked punt and possession on the Hurricane 35 and a HC INT by Tiger DB, David Arevalo.

The Hurricanes opened the scoring with a FG by Simon Hales, followed by a deep corner aerial TD from Hunter Prus to Aaron McCardie.Hales converted and Holland was up 10-0 with three minutes remaining till half time.The Tiger offence came alive and Dante Gabrielli scored with 29 seconds remaining on a three yard run.Liam Masner’s PAT was good, leaving Dal down only three points.But HC would start the 3rd Q with the ball.

I don’t know what was said at the half, but the Tigers came out with their normal powerful offence.Caden Quong scored from six yards out, which was followed by a 39 yard Gabrielli toss to Riley Beazley for a major.Masner converted both.Dal’s “D” continued to show their tenacity as they forced the Hurricanes to give up two safety touches, making the score, 25-10 early in the 4th.

Momentum began to turn in Holland’s favour as the Tigers gave up turnovers on special teams and offence.Prus connected with his favourite receiver on the day, Wolfgangus Sym for a TD and later on a two point convert to tie the game at 25-25. Pierre Saunders had scored that 6.Through 3 Qs, the black and gold had managed to some what stay out of the penalty box, maybe 5 at most.But in the span of a little over 3 minutes they picked up four flags, aiding HC to tie the score.Prior to this, Oranye Egbuna, shone on defence, making numerous tackles, recovering a fumble and intercepting a pass.Kyle Merk and Liam Chisari also made multiple hits.

The last three minutes of regulation had a large contingent of Hurricane fans and Tiger supporters on the edge of their seats as both teams went for the win in regulation time.

Overtime came and the Hurricanes had first possession and completed a long pass, but then the tough Tiger “D” held.HC connected on a short FG.Now the black and gold could score a TD and win.The Dalhousie line led by captain Louis Fiset, blocked their way to the game winning score by Quong.Tiger fans lept to their feet and the Dal team bench erupted and sprinted their way to the end zone to celebrate the roller coaster victory!

Could this be another “Year of the Tiger”?The Tigers will enjoy the bye week and watch the AFL semi, to see if the Reds or Hurricanes will venture to Wickwire Field to continue the rivalry!GO TIGERS!!!
