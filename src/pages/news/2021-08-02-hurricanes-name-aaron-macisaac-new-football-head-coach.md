The Holland Hurricanes men’s football team will have a familiar face leading them into the 2021 season as intercollegiate sports make the comeback after a one-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Aaron MacIsaac makes his return to the Hurricanes as the new head coach after spending time as an offensive coach with the program from 2010 to 2012.

MacIsaac, of Kinkora, PEI, spent the last eight years as an assistant coach with the Saint Francis Xavier (St. FX) University X-Men in the Atlantic University Sport (AUS) and U Sports.

“I am beyond excited and honoured to be named as the next Hurricanes head coach,” shared MacIsaac. “Having had the opportunity to be on the inaugural coaching staff back in 2010, and on the team that won our first championship back in 2011, it makes this opportunity that much more special for me.”

As a player, MacIsaac was an offensive lineman for the Saint Mary’s University (SMU) Huskies at the university level; he also played for Team New Brunswick and at the Moncton High School.

“I am excited to meet the team and start building a cohesive unit. I will have expectations of every player in the program. First and foremost, we need to handle our educational goals. Football is a privilege, not a right, and studies have to come first. Next, we have to be community leaders. Every player needs to represent Holland College on and off of the field. If we are successful at that, and we put in the hard work, we will be successful on the field.”

Albert Roche, Director of Athletics and Recreation at Holland College, is confident in MacIsaac’s abilities.

“Aaron is a wonderful fit for our program,” shared Roche. “He is keenly aware of the Island football scene in his role with Football PEI. His playing career alongside his recent coaching experience at St. FX gives him an ideal background to take the reins of a collegiate football team. It is evident he wants to build our program and his passion for the game is truly an asset. We are confident Aaron will provide a quality experience for our student-athletes. We look forward to getting our squad back on the gridiron led by Aaron and his coaching staff. We’d also like to thank Owen MacWilliams for stepping into the role on an interim basis over the winter and assist us in the transition to this announcement. We wish Owen the best of luck in his new role at St. FX.”

The Hurricanes, the Atlantic Football League (AFL) champions in 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015, fell in the league championship game in 2019 to the University of New Brunswick (UNB) in the final minute of play. The 2020 season was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

“It will be nice to get back to the field and have fans to play in front of,” shared MacIsaac. “This last year has been a challenge, but we are starting to open up and getting back to all the activities we enjoy. Hurricanes football will be hitting the field this season looking to get back to the finals and finish what we started back in 2019."

The Holland Hurricanes will kick-off their 2021 training camp on August 27.
