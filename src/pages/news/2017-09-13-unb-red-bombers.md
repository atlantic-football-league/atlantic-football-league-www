## Honouring the Champions

### Saturday Sept 30, 11:00am, Pre-Game Warm-up.

All Red Bomber alumni and their friends and family gather at the Colter Room in the Aitken Centre at 11:00 to renew old friendships. Mike Dollimore will host the event. No better man to bridge the champions. Mike played on the 1970 AIAA Championship team, knows everyone on the 1969 AIAA Championship team, and was Head Coach of the 2009 and 2012 AFL Championship teams.

### Sat. 12:45, Alumni and current Red Bombers:

The Walk As you can see from the photo below the Red Bombers’ entrance onto BMO Centre field from the Aitken Centre is still referred to as “the walk”. We would like to have the returning players, coaches, trainers and managers who are with us from all Red Bombers teams join today’s Red Bombers” intermingled with them as they come down onto the field to what else but “Bombers Away”: including our fight song being sung by the Golden Club Chorus. Coach Dollimore will be at the head of the stairs to fold you in, and Ian MacMillan will greet you at the bottom of the stairs to direct you to centre field to join UNB’s president Eddy Campbell for the opening ceremonies, and unfurling the championship banners.

After the opening ceremonies make your way to the banners for pictures.
Post-Game Gathering at the Colter Room in the Aitken Centre After the game, the Colter Room will be open with a Cash Bar, where all Alumni, Coach McCullough and his staff, and some of the current Red Bombers can join you to discuss the game.

We hope that the photos below jog your memory of great teams and teammates forever. Of course, with today’s technology, the 2012 champions have the advantage of film courtesy of a STU Journalism Student.
