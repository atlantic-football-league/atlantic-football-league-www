title: Tigers 25 - Red Bombers 0
author: Brian Gilliland, Brian Freeman
---

With a scoreless second half and the Red Bombers almost opening the scoring at the 8 minute mark of the first quarter but turning the ball over on the Tiger 2 yard line, the game was decided in the 2nd quarter which started at 0-0 and ended 23-0 for the Tigers. The Bombers conceding a safety with 2 minutes left in the game for field position was the only scoring in the second half. Needless to say the Alumni Cup remains in Dalhousie for another year.

The Bombers (1-2) had a tough schedule with both games against Dal in the first half of the season. The Bombers are setting themselves to finish the rest of their season with a winning record, get through the semi’s and then meet these Tigers in the Final.

We enjoyed an outstanding Red Bombers Reunion over the weekend as we honoured Jim Born and his teams between 1971 – 1980 at a pre-game reception and in our pre-game ceremony that included UNB President Eddy Campbell. Red Bombers from all eras were here from all over the county sharing stories from the day and catching up with old friends throughout the weekend, and at the Colter Room after the game.

Next week’s game will be a home game as well at 1:00 on Saturday Oct 8 against our cross–campus rivals the UNBSJ Seawolves. It will also be the Red Bombers All-Star game where Eric Smith Offense, and Stan Barnaby Defense will be inducted to the All Star Wall for the 2011 Red Bombers Team.
