title: "The Rivers’ Report: Hurricanes Win Rematch"

It could have been the worst of times as Dalhousie went down 29-10 in the first half against Holland College.  And it was almost the best of times in the third quarter as the Tigers showed spunk, when  they rallied to be down 36-28 with 12:36 remaining in the game.  This was a rematch of   last year’s AFL final as the Cats completed an undefeated season defeating the defending champs.  The Hurricanes prevailed this time, 46-28.

The temperature was coolish and the moon shone brightly, a perfect night to play. The Tigers scored first on a line drive field goal by Ryan Merlin.  But it was all Holland College for the rest of the half as Randy Crowe completed touchdown passes to Cole Brydges, Samuel Valerie, Brennan Davis and Tyler Majuary.  The quick t of HC’s running back, Andre Goulbourne, were problematic at times.

The third quarter saw a huge turn around as the black and gold outscored the maroon and white, 18-0.  The Tiger D created some big breaks for the O with an interception(Keneford) and two fumble(Whidden and MacNeil). Majd Ibrahim led the hit parade with seven on the day. Kenzie MacNeil and Nathan Whidden had five each while Tyson Young, Tommy Panther, Zack Leger and Liam Manson all had 4 Hurricane stops.

Tiger majors in the game came from Leger on a short run, Chris Duplisea on a sneak and a TD pass to Jack Underhill.  Merlin contributed another FG.  Underhill led receivers with three catches on the day for 57 yards and Leger had eleven carries for 57 yards and Kuhn 9 for 54.  Kuhn’s open field running gave him 99 yards on five kick returns.

The fourth Q started and the Tigers were still in it.  But a Davis to Brydges major and a Davis PAT and FG saw the final score, 46-28 for Holland.  These two teams will have an exciting rematch on PEI on October 31, their final regular season game.

The Tigers are off to Saint John this Saturday.  But mark Sunday, October 15th at one o’clock on your calendar as Dalhousie plays their Homecoming game trying to avenge an earlier loss to the UNBF Red Bombers and take their third consecutive Alumni Cup.

See you there!  Go Tigers!
