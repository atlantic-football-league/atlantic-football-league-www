## Final Games as Red Bombers

This AFL Championship will mark the last game as a Red Bomber for WR Mitch McCoy (4) and DT Matt Fagan (40) who are completing their senior year. After outstanding High School careers both with Oromocto High, Mitch was recruited by the Ottawa Gee Gee’s for the 2011 season and Matt by the Acadia Axemen. Mitch found his way home to UNB and the Red Bombers and was part of the Red Bombers 2012 Championship team and was later named the AFL League MVP in 2015. Mitch missed much of the 2016 season due to an ankle injury suffered in the first game of that season. 2016 however was the year Matt Fagan (40) came to the Red Bombers. This big man has anchored our DL and has been an inspiration for everyone who has played with him.

Mitch and Matt have had one mission in 2017, and that’s tomorrow.
