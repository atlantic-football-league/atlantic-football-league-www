title: Saint John Seawolves Forfeit Game Against Hurricanes
---

***Charlottetown –*** The Saint John Seawolves has forfeited the game slated for this Saturday against the Holland Hurricanes, officials announced today.

The forfeiture is due to Seawolves’ injuries and the resulting lack of able players. Hurricanes head coach Ross Young said the forfeiture is regrettable, but that the ‘Canes will still be on the field this Saturday for training if fans would like to come out to see the team, which was looking forward to playing only its second home game of the season.

“It’s an unfortunate turn of events for both teams,” he said. “Our players, prospects, and their families were looking forward to Saturday’s game, so we’ll be on the field from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. to practice, and look forward to demonstrating how the team is shaping up as we near the end of the season.”

The Hurricanes will go up against the Dalhousie Tigers next Saturday, October 21, at 1 p.m. as scheduled, in a game that will determine the final placements for the season, and the matchups for the playoffs. The practice this Saturday and the game next week will be on the ‘Cane’s home field, MacAdam Field at UPEI Alumni Canada Games Place.
