As the 2024 fall season approaches, the Holland Hurricanes are ready to make their mark. With a blend of returning talent and exciting new recruits, the Hurricanes are set to compete for the championship this fall. Here’s an in-depth look at what fans can expect from the Hurricanes this season.

The Holland Hurricanes football team is gearing up for what head coach Aaron MacIsaac describes as a defining season in the Atlantic Football League (AFL). After a challenging 2023 campaign that saw the team finish with a 1-5 record, the Hurricanes are looking to bounce back in a big way. Key returners such as wide receiver Aaron McCardle, offensive lineman Zack Goodsell, linebacker Owen McLeod, and defensive lineman Josh Hartlen will provide leadership on the field. The team has also bolstered its roster with recruits like offensive linemen Keiran Richards and Treyvon Collings, wide receiver Keegan Cardona, and linebacker Isaac Webb.

"2024 is shaping up to be a defining season for the Hurricanes program. We have had a strong recruiting year and many returning players. The offseason efforts of the coaching staff were second to none, and everyone is energized entering camp," said MacIsaac.

The coaching staff sees the addition of Jeremy Pike, a former St. FX player with championship experience, as a significant asset, while Angel Briones has exited the team.

The Hurricanes will open their season at home on September 14 against UNB, which also marks “Back to School Day.” Other key games include matchups against Dalhousie on September 22 (“Family Day”) and Saint John on October 6 (“Community Day”), with the final regular season game taking place on October 20 against Dalhousie in Halifax.
