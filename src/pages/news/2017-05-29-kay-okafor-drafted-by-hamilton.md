*Monday, May 29, 2017. Charlottetown –* Former Holland College Hurricane Kay Okafor has been drafted by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Okafor, who played for the Hurricanes in 2012 while attending U.P.E.I., was selected in the third round, 21st overall, in the 2017 CFL draft. Right now, he’s at the team’s training camp, preparing for the season, which starts June 8.
 
Michael O’Grady, president of the team, said the Hurricanes are delighted with Okafor’s success.

“We are very proud of what Kay has accomplished, as a student and as an athlete. We knew he had special abilities and tremendous potential the day he walked into our training camp. We wish him all the best as he pursues his career. We are confident that he will be a success wherever his interests take him,” he said.

Okafor, who had never played football before joining the Hurricanes as a defensive lineman, credits his time on the team with helping him to develop as a player.

"Holland College gave me my very first opportunity with the game of football. I will always be grateful for the amazing coaches, staff, and teammates I had during my time there. They were very patient with me, and this helped make me love the game of football even more. In a way, I wouldn't be where I am today without Holland College. They will always have a special place in my heart," he said.
