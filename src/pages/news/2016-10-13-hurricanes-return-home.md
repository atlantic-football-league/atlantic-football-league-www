title: Hurricanes return home, aim to secure home field advantage in first round of playoffs

Both teams have a lot to play for on Saturday.

After losing in Halifax last weekend, the Holland College Hurricanes fell in a tie for second place with the UNB Red Bombers, setting up an important meeting between the two squads at MacAdam Field.

“This game is significant for our team,” said head coach Ross Young. “We’re playing for home field advantage when the playoffs start.”

Despite sharing 2-2 records, the Hurricanes are confident they can come away with a win when it matters most.

“We’re treating this game like the playoffs. The players know what’s at stake.”

It will be the second time the teams met this year. In their first matchup, the Hurricanes fell to the Red Bombers in Fredericton in a 27-21 overtime thriller. In that game, Holland College held two 14-point leads before UNB took over late in the third quarter and again in overtime.

UNB’s ground attack was too much for the Hurricanes, racking up over 200 yards rushing, but Young said his team will be more prepared for the Red Bombers’ run-centric offence.

“We’re game planning a little differently this time around,” he said. “I respect their run game, so we’ve made some defensive adjustments.”

After spending three-quarters of the season on the road, the Hurricanes return home for their final two games, a luxury Young is hoping will pay off down the stretch.

“To come back to a place where you’re comfortable in and had success in helps a lot,” he said. “The fans give us that extra boost of confidence.”

The game will be held at the UPEI Alumni Canada Games Place on Oct. 15 at noon.
