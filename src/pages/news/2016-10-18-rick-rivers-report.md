The Dalhousie Tigers are making their own football history.  On a full moon night at Wickwire Field and in front of a raucous howling Homecoming crowd, the black and gold thumped the UNB Saint John Seawolves, 57-7.  That score eclipsed 56 points scored in Dal's second game ever.  At Holland College seven years ago, the Tigers took a 42-7 lead at half time and held on for a 56-42 triumph in the shot out on island turf..

This season has truly been a team effort and rookie head coach, Mark Haggett, should be praised for the coaching staff he has put together!  It takes a village to raise a child and it takes skillful caring coaches to mould 45 plus players into a potential championship team.

Let's give credit where credit is due.  Vlad Orlov and Mike Parkhill have shaped the O line for the running back's coach, Matt Burke.  A high powered, high scoring 0 focuses on the intelligent systems of the energetic OC, Evan Brown.  The tech knowledge of Air Force leader, Tarek El-Bitar, sees his receivers improving with each outing.

DC, Steve Majury has seen his D only allow two touchdowns in 5 games!  Majury doubles as the LB guru and HC, Haggett, delivers dexterity to the DL which helps to neutralize the opponent's OL.  Not to be forgotten are the DBs under Chico Francis who have all but neutralized any aerial long gains.

Individually the game saw Hunsley have another high percentage completion game, going 21-27 for 231 yards with 2 tds and no ints.  Bernier led the receiving core with 8 catches for 107 and a td while Muise had 7 for 72 and Gauvin 4 for 45, with one major.

The D had a sack show led by Legault with 3 and Connor and Liam Manson 2 each.  The tumultuous resistance also forced 4 fumble recoveries, one resulting in a six points for Connor Manson.  Hard hitting was prevalent everywhere but the most surprising was made by ecto-mesomorph Davis.

Dalhousie has made history and won the impressive Jack Irving Cup for finishing first in the AFL.  But with one more regular season victory, the Tigers would have a perfect regular season and no present or distant past black and gold squad has ever achieved that distinction.

Coach Haggett and his hand-picked staff will keep their athletes hungry, humble and working hard.  The Tigers will not have to go on the road for this year's final and that is a distinct advantage!  Three wins will bring the elusive AFL title and make history.  The Year of the Tiger will be declared and that hasn't been celebrated since 1954. GO TIGERS!
