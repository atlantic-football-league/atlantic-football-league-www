title: Hurricanes preparing for tough battle against Dalhousie Tigers
location: Charlottetown, PE

The Holland Hurricanes football team are preparing for what could be their toughest game so far this season, when they host the undefeated Dalhousie Tigers this Saturday at 1 p.m. at UPEI Canada Games Alumni Place.

The Hurricanes and the Tigers are tied for first place in the Atlantic Football League with identical 2-0 records, and head coach Andrew Hickey said the 2013 Moosehead Cup champions have no illusions about the upcoming game.

“We’re starting to solidify as a team, but we’re going to have to work very hard to close some of the gaps that were evident in last Sunday’s game,” he said.

Last week, the ‘Canes battled the UNB Fredericton Red Bombers, finally winning 37-20. Hickey said the team missed out on some good opportunities, and this week, they can’t afford to let that happen again.

“In practice this week, we’ve been tightening up some of the plays and generally making sure that the players are focused on the game,” he said.
