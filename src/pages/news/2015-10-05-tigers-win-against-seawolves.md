title: Tigers Win Against Seawolves

---

After two close loses, the Dalhousie Football Tigers defeated the UNBSJ Sea Wolves 37-9.  It was the running of Zach Leger who scored three majors that was the difference.

Punter/placekicker, Rob Wilson opened the scoring for the Tigers with a single but the Sea Wolves quickly responded with an eighteen yard aerial touchdown from Sean Galbraith to Adam Spurrell.

Tigers' Graham Felix's 76 yard pick six in the second quarter along with 12 and 3 yard majors by Leger would put Dal up for good.  Wilson converted one and the score was 21-7 at the half.

Both teams would exchange safeties in the third quarter and Nick Hunsley connected with Alex Bayne on an 18 yard TD to make the score, 30-9.  An electrifying 56 yard run major by Leger and Wilson's last two PATs made the final score Dalhousie 37 and Saint John 9.

The Tigers will travel to Saint John next Saturday and will return home on October 17th for Homecoming and the inaugural Alumni Cup with the UNBF Red Bombers.
