**DALHOUSIE DOMINATES**



The Tigers finished their regular season with an impressive 40-7 victory over UNBSJ Seawolves! Also on Saturday the UNBF Reds came from behind to defeat the Holland College Hurricanes 50-34, to secure first place in the AFL. This means Dal finishes 2nd and will play the Hurricanes at Wickwire at 7:00pm on Saturday. If the B and G win and the Reds triumph, the AFL championship will be held in Fredericton the following Saturday.



It was an ideal day for football, bright, sunny and mild with the only negative being high winds. Matthew Irvine, replacing the injured Okyay Kepenek, started well by kicking a single on the opening kickoff. Irvine made all his PATs and kicked another single. The Seawolves also gave up two safeties to add to the Tigers’ score.



Javier Reyes Landry had a career game as he spun and sprinted to three touchdowns carrying the ball 21 times for 195 yards. His game was set from his first carry when he started inside and then sprinted outside for 64 yards only to be stopped on the UNBSJ four. Two plays later he went over from the one. Great credit should be given to the Dal O line!



Starting Tiger QB, Noah Carter, 7/14 for 84 yards with one scoring pass to Steve Sorenson of 27 yards. Glover shared duties with Grayson Dominques who was 7/12 for 46 yards and he had a one yard TD sneak. Aidan Keefe, the B and G leading receiver in the game, was targeted 7 times and caught six passes for 61 yards.



The D was back to their regular strength but did break once as Riley Ring-Dineen completed a 75 yard pass and run TD to Brayden Robinson for the Seawolves only score. Leading the Tigers’ D was Matthew Fernandes with two sacks while Yassine Yassine and Mike MacKenzie had one each. Tops on the hit parade were Logan Hillier with 8 while Riley Fitzpatrick and Jeremy Miller had four apiece. Other positive stats saw Connor McCormick with a pick and Max Parker a blocked punt.



The only real negative team stat was again, too many penalties! There was quite a variety; illegal blocks, offsides, holding, unnecessary roughness and a couple for pass interference, for a total of nine. As mentioned in an earlier report, these could be negative game breakers and could lead to a team loss.



The Dalhousie Tigers will return home to Wickwire Field for a 7:00 pm start for an AFL semi-final game. A win at home will have them travel to UNBF provided the Reds defeat the Seawolves. The Hurricanes are no pushovers as shown earlier in the season as it took the Tigers a full four quarters to defeat them. Come show your Tiger pride and be our 13th man (Tiger)! You can make the difference! **GO TIGERS!!**
